# Testing Compliance Contract

This file is the single source of truth for test implementation compliance in this repository.

## Consumers

Testing consumers MUST follow this contract:

- Consumer: `.github/skills/acceptance-testing/SKILL.md`
  - Role: Implementer
  - Command: `/acceptance-testing`
  - Requires EOF Load: yes
  - Goal: write or troubleshoot acceptance tests under `internal/**/*_test.go` while applying `TEST-*` rules.

- Consumer: `.github/instructions/ai-skill-routing-tests.instructions.md`
  - Role: Router
  - Requires EOF Load: no
  - Goal: route acceptance-test work through the testing contract and acceptance-testing skill.

## Canonical sources of truth (precedence)

Use these sources with the following roles:

- Current workspace contributor guidance
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- This contract
  - Authoritative for testing compliance, precedence, and core `TEST-*` rules in this repository.
- Target-provider contributor guidance, when present in the workspace or explicitly fetched as evidence
  - `contributing/README.md`
  - `contributing/topics/**/*.md`

Conflict resolution:

- This contract is authoritative for test implementation compliance in this repository.
- Current workspace contributor guidance is authoritative for repo-specific expectations that affect test behavior or execution safety.
- Target-provider contributor guidance is the baseline reference when workspace evidence is insufficient, but this contract may be stricter to reduce drift and ambiguity.
- If target-provider contributor guidance adds or tightens a testing standard, update this contract so coverage is preserved.
- If a companion testing guide differs from this contract, follow this contract and update the companion guide to re-align.

## Detailed companion guidance

These files provide worked examples, testing patterns, and specialized heuristics. They are companion guidance, not an independent compliance layer:

- `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md`

## Rule IDs

Rules are identified by stable IDs so the skill and routing layer can reference the same requirements without drifting.

ID format:
- `TEST-<AREA>-<NNN>`

Areas:
- `EVID` = evidence and verification guardrails
- `WF` = testing workflow expectations
- `RUN` = safe test execution guidance
- `PATTERN` = acceptance test patterns and assertions

## Rule provenance

Some rules in this contract come from published upstream standards, while others are inferred from repeated provider testing patterns or added locally to reduce drift.

Use the following provenance labels when a rule needs extra source clarity:

- `Published upstream standard`: explicitly documented by upstream contributor or provider testing guidance.
- `Inferred maintainer convention`: not clearly codified upstream, but supported by repeated provider test patterns or accepted maintainer guidance.
- `Local safeguard`: a repository-local rule added to reduce ambiguity, drift, or under-specified test coverage.

Provenance rollout is incremental. New rules and touched ambiguous rules should include provenance notes first; older rules may be backfilled over time.

## Evidence hierarchy

When a testing claim affects required test shape, execution safety, or assertion strategy, use this evidence order:

1. Current workspace contributor guidance and this contract
2. Existing nearby `_test.go` implementations under `internal/**`, especially same-service tests
3. Provider implementation behavior under test when assertion strategy depends on schema or CRUD behavior
4. Target-provider contributor guidance when present

If evidence is missing for a behavior-changing testing claim, do not guess.

# Contract Rules

## Evidence and verification

### TEST-EVID-001: Do not invent acceptance patterns
- Rule: Do not invent new acceptance-test structure when an existing provider test pattern already covers the scenario.
- Rule: Use nearby same-service tests as the primary pattern source for test naming, configuration helpers, assertion style, and scenario selection.

## Workflow

### TEST-WF-001: Prefer narrow, scenario-focused test updates
- Rule: Add only the smallest set of acceptance-test scenarios needed to validate the changed behavior.
- Rule: Do not add broad or redundant test coverage when existing `basic`, `requiresImport`, `update`, or import patterns already cover the behavior acceptably.

### TEST-WF-002: Resource acceptance tests should cover the core lifecycle by default
- Rule: For resource acceptance tests, the default expected matrix is `basic`, `requiresImport`, `complete`, and `update`, plus import validation when import is supported.
- Rule: Only omit one of those scenarios when the resource behavior or provider pattern gives a concrete reason that the scenario is not applicable.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-acceptance-testing.md` under `Which Tests are Required?`
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-resource.md` Step 8 and Step 9 examples

### TEST-WF-002A: Use resource-specific `preCheck` helpers for optional prerequisites
- Rule: When an acceptance test has prerequisites beyond the global Azure auth and location requirements, add a receiver method named `preCheck(t *testing.T)` on the test helper struct and call it near the start of each affected `TestAcc...`.
- Rule: Use `t.Skip(...)` or `t.Skipf(...)` for optional or environment-specific prerequisites that are not universally available, rather than failing the test with `t.Fatalf(...)`.
- Rule: Keep `preCheck` close to the tests that call it, commonly after the `TestAcc...` functions and before the `Exists` or `Destroy` helpers.
- Rule: Do not duplicate the framework's global Azure-auth pre-check inside resource-specific `preCheck` helpers.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-acceptance-testing.md` under `PreCheck Helpers`
  - That guidance recommends receiver-based `preCheck(t *testing.T)` helpers, skipping when optional prerequisites are absent, and keeping the helper close to the tests that call it

### TEST-WF-003: New resources with list resources should include list query coverage
- Rule: When adding a new resource that includes a list resource, add list-resource acceptance coverage using Terraform 1.14 query tests.
- Rule: The list-resource test should provision multiple resources, exercise the base list query, and cover at least one narrowed query path when the list configuration supports it.
- Rule: Only omit list-resource acceptance coverage when the list resource itself is legitimately omitted under the maintainer-reviewed exception path.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` under `Add Acceptance Tests for this List Resource`
  - Upstream contributor guidance there shows Terraform 1.14 query-based tests as the expected validation path for list resources added alongside new resources

### TEST-WF-004: Ephemeral resource tests should use the framework ephemeral test pattern
- Rule: Acceptance tests for provider ephemeral resources should use the service-local `*_ephemeral_test.go` pattern with `acceptance.BuildTestData(t, "ephemeral.azurerm_<name>", ...)`.
- Rule: Ephemeral-resource acceptance tests should gate on Terraform 1.10 support and use the framework provider factories required by the upstream ephemeral pattern.
- Rule: When the test needs to assert the ephemeral result payload, prefer the `echo` provider pattern with config-state checks rather than inventing a custom assertion mechanism.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/services/keyvault/key_vault_secret_ephemeral_test.go`
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/services/keyvault/key_vault_certificate_ephemeral_test.go`

### TEST-WF-005: Provider-defined functions should use focused framework unit tests
- Rule: Provider-defined function tests should live under `internal/provider/function/*_test.go` and use `resource.UnitTest` with framework provider factories.
- Rule: Provider-defined function tests should gate on Terraform 1.8 support and prove outputs from `provider::azurerm::<name>(...)` calls rather than inventing a resource-style lifecycle harness.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/provider/function/parse_resource_id_test.go`
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/provider/function/normalise_resource_id_test.go`

## Execution safety

### TEST-RUN-001: Treat acceptance tests as real Azure activity
- Rule: Acceptance tests create real Azure resources and may incur cost.
- Rule: Prefer narrow test runs and avoid recommending full-suite runs when a single targeted `-run` scope will validate the change.

## Test patterns

### TEST-PATTERN-001: Basic acceptance tests should prove existence
- Rule: In a basic acceptance test, the primary check should prove the object exists in Azure, typically via `check.That(data.ResourceName).ExistsInAzure(r)` when that pattern fits.

### TEST-PATTERN-002: Prefer ImportStep for broad validation
- Rule: Prefer `data.ImportStep()` for broad post-create validation when import is supported.
- Rule: Add extra assertions only when import cannot validate the behavior you need to prove.

### TEST-PATTERN-003: Complete tests should cover the full supported shape when needed
- Rule: Include a `complete` acceptance test for resource scenarios so the broader supported configuration surface is exercised alongside `basic` and `update` coverage.
- Rule: Only omit `complete` coverage when there is concrete evidence that the resource shape does not warrant a distinct complete scenario.
- Rule: Do not treat category-specific, subtype-specific, or otherwise narrower targeted scenarios as satisfying `complete` coverage when the resource still exposes a broader supported shape.
- Rule: When a new managed resource exposes optional metadata, optional blocks, or multiple supported shapes beyond the narrow success path, that broader shape normally warrants a distinct `complete` scenario.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Existing guidance in `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md` listing `Complete Test` in the essential resource-test set
  - Existing provider test organization guidance in `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md` that orders success scenarios around `basic`, `update`, and related lifecycle coverage

### TEST-PATTERN-004: RequiresImport coverage is part of the default resource test matrix
- Rule: Include `requiresImport` coverage for resources by default, typically using `data.RequiresImportErrorStep` and a dedicated `requiresImport` config builder.
- Rule: Only omit `requiresImport` coverage when there is concrete evidence that the resource pattern makes it not applicable.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-acceptance-testing.md` under `Which Tests are Required?`
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-acceptance-testing.md` under `Example - Resource - Requires Import`

### TEST-PATTERN-005: Do not add acctests for simple property validation when unit tests already cover it
- Rule: Do not add an acceptance test only to prove simple property validation behavior when that validation is already covered adequately by a unit test.
- Rule: Prefer unit tests for property-validator coverage unless there is concrete evidence that an acceptance test is needed to prove behavior not exercised at the unit-test level.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Maintainer review guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm` PR `#31957` comment `discussion_r3116940446`: `we don't normally add acctests for property validation and this is covered in the unit test already`
  - Existing testing guidance in `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md` already distinguishes targeted validation/error scenarios from broader lifecycle acceptance coverage

### TEST-PATTERN-006: Add acctests for CustomizeDiff logic so validation behavior is not left untested
- Rule: Add acceptance-test coverage for CustomizeDiff logic that enforces invalid field combinations, Azure-specific cross-field constraints, or other provider validation behavior that would otherwise be untested.
- Rule: Use targeted `ExpectError` acceptance scenarios for invalid CustomizeDiff paths, while relying on the broader `basic`, `update`, `complete`, and import scenarios for the corresponding success paths unless extra assertions are needed.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Existing guidance in `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md` under `CustomizeDiff Testing` says invalid field combinations should be covered with acceptance tests and notes that success scenarios are usually covered by the broader lifecycle test set
  - Existing local testing guidance explains that CustomizeDiff prevents invalid Azure API calls and is therefore regression-prone if left unexercised

### TEST-PATTERN-007: Inline one-use helper arguments in fmt.Sprintf-based config builders
- Rule: In acceptance-test helper functions that return `fmt.Sprintf(...)` configuration strings, do not assign one-use helper results such as `template := r.template(data)` or `config := r.basic(data)` to a local variable only to pass them immediately into `fmt.Sprintf(...)`.
- Rule: Pass those one-use helper calls directly as `fmt.Sprintf(...)` arguments instead, for example `r.template(data)` or `r.basic(data)` inline.
- Rule: Only introduce a local variable for a nested helper result when it is reused, materially improves readability, or is needed for additional transformation before formatting.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Maintainer review guidance in upstream PR `#28834`: `We're pushing away from this pattern as it's unnecessary to assign the template to a var when it can be passed into the test directly.`
  - That same review guidance explicitly asks contributors to update new tests to use the inline `fmt.Sprintf(..., r.template(data), ...)` form and avoid adding more single-use template locals

### TEST-PATTERN-008: Acctest helper struct names must stay canonical across all test variants
- Rule: In acceptance test files under `internal/services/**`, helper struct names for a given Terraform resource or data source must use the canonical generated pattern based on the Terraform name.
- Rule: For each Terraform resource or data source surface, use one canonical helper type and keep it stable across all related acceptance test files.
- Rule: If the surface already has an established canonical helper type, preserve and reuse that same type across all related acceptance tests and generated identity tests.
- Rule: For new surfaces that do not yet have an established canonical helper type, prefer `ToCamel(x)Resource` for resources and `ToCamel(x)DataSource` for data sources.
- Rule: That canonical helper type should stay the same across all acceptance test variants for the same Terraform surface, including the main resource test file, list-test files, identity-related tests, and any other acceptance test file that instantiates the helper.
- Rule: Generated identity tests under `*_identity_gen_test.go` must use that same canonical helper type directly.
- Rule: For new surfaces that use generated identity tests, the canonical helper type must match the helper name emitted by the resource-identity generator for that Terraform resource name unless the shared generator itself is intentionally being changed.
- Rule: Before finalizing helper-type names for a new resource with Resource Identity support, run the narrow `go generate` command for that resource to verify the generated helper-name casing and prevent `*_resource_identity_gen_test.go` drift.
- Rule: When a surface already has an established canonical helper type in hand-written acceptance tests, preserve that helper type across all related tests and ensure generated identity tests align with it. Do not introduce alternate helper names for branding or file-local convenience.
- Rule: Do not preserve Azure product branding or alternate casing in acceptance-test helper names if that causes `go generate` to rewrite `*_resource_identity_gen_test.go`.
- Rule: If there is a mismatch between hand-written acceptance tests and generated identity tests, resolve it by aligning the canonical helper type or by making an intentional shared generator change. Do not hand-edit the generated identity test.
- Rule: Do not introduce variant-specific helper types such as `SomethingIdentityResource` or other alternate names merely because the test lives in a different file or generated identity file.
- Rule: Do not rely on adapter methods, alias types, or wrapper structs to bridge helper-type drift to generated identity tests.
- Rule: Keep helper-type naming stable across all acceptance tests and generated identity tests so `go generate` produces no diff and Generation Check stays green.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to keep all acceptance-test helper struct names aligned to one canonical type per Terraform surface, whether the surface is a resource or a data source, so different test variants and generated identity tests do not drift apart.
  - Current upstream `internal/services/**` patterns are mixed on the exact suffix shape for older surfaces, so the durable invariant is preserving the established canonical helper type for a surface rather than forcing a suffix-only rename across existing tests.
  - Upstream PR `#32194` showed the failure mode: canonical helper types for a Terraform surface diverged from the helper types used by generated identity tests, causing `go generate` to rewrite generated files and making Generation Check fail until the generated identity tests used the canonical helper types directly.
  - Local failure analysis for `azurerm_cdn_frontdoor_batch_rule_set` showed the narrower casing drift problem: the generator emitted `CdnFrontdoor...` while the hand-written helper used `CdnFrontDoor...`, and the correct fix was to align the canonical helper type so hand-written and generated tests matched rather than hand-editing the generated test or broadening shared generator behavior for a one-off case.

### TEST-PATTERN-009: Data source tests should prefer the associated resource complete config by default
- Rule: When a data source acceptance test needs managed resources as setup and the associated resource exposes a `complete(data)` helper, prefer that helper as the default setup shape.
- Rule: Use `basic(data)` or another scenario-specific associated resource helper instead when no `complete(data)` helper exists, when the test is intentionally narrow, or when `complete(data)` would introduce unrelated setup, noise, or coupling.
- Rule: Do not infer that every data source test must use `complete(data)`; the default preference does not remove author choice for scenario-specific setup.
- Rule: Do not rewrite a data source test away from `complete(data)` or another broader helper when the scenario genuinely depends on the fuller associated resource shape.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor-doc PR `#32406` narrows the `fmt.Sprintf(...)` helper guidance without turning data source setup into a single mandatory helper shape, leaving room for defaulting to the fuller associated resource config while preserving scenario-based exceptions.
  - Data sources commonly assert computed fields exposed from the managed resource state, so preferring the associated resource `complete(data)` helper when it exists gives the AI a more deterministic default while still allowing narrower setup when the test intentionally targets a smaller shape.

### TEST-PATTERN-010: Embedded Terraform in acceptance tests must use repository-valid indentation
- Rule: In embedded Terraform configuration blocks inside `*_test.go` files, indent configuration lines with two spaces and never tabs.
- Rule: When editing Terraform heredocs in acceptance tests, preserve the surrounding file's Terraform formatting and treat tab-indented configuration lines as invalid, since they can fail the repository's acceptance-test formatting checks.
- Rule: Do not rely on Go linting or Go test execution to detect formatting issues inside embedded Terraform configuration strings.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Repository acceptance-test formatting checks can reject embedded Terraform heredocs in `*_test.go` files even when the Go code itself passes `golangci-lint`.
  - Local CI failure analysis showed tab-indented Terraform configuration lines causing `make tflint` to fail on acceptance-test formatting, so the durable rule is two-space indentation and no tabs inside embedded Terraform config blocks.

### TEST-PATTERN-011: Provider feature-flagged CRUD branch coverage
- Rule: When a provider-level `features` setting changes create, update, delete, import, overwrite, or destroy semantics, add targeted acceptance-test coverage for the non-default branch when feasible.
- Rule: Prefer one focused acceptance test for the shared branch behavior rather than duplicating equivalent coverage across every sibling resource, unless the resources have materially different behavior.
- Rule: When exercising that branch requires a pre-existing remote object, use existing client callback patterns such as `CheckWithClientForResource`, `CheckWithClientWithoutResource`, or `CheckWithClient`, as appropriate, to prepare the remote object outside Terraform before applying the feature-enabled configuration.
- Rule: Do not model this scenario by introducing a second Terraform-managed resource with the same remote ID merely to trigger the branch, unless the resource pattern specifically requires that shape.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Provider feature flags can materially alter CRUD semantics without changing the default test matrix shape, so the default `basic`, `requiresImport`, `complete`, `update`, and import scenarios do not reliably prove the feature-enabled branch.
  - Existing acceptance harness helpers already support direct Azure setup through client callback checks, which is the provider-consistent way to prepare pre-existing remote state for these scenarios.

### TEST-PATTERN-012: Callback-based Azure pollers need explicit deadlines in acceptance setup helpers
- Rule: When `CheckWithClientForResource(...)`, `CheckWithClientWithoutResource(...)`, or `CheckWithClient(...)` callbacks call Azure polling helpers such as `CreateOrUpdateThenPoll(...)`, `CreateOrReplaceThenPoll(...)`, `UpdateThenPoll(...)`, or `DeleteThenPoll(...)`, do not pass the provided callback `ctx` directly into the poller.
- Rule: First wrap the callback `ctx` with `context.WithTimeout(...)` or `context.WithDeadline(...)` before calling the poller.
- Rule: Use a timeout appropriate for the setup or mutation operation, commonly 15 to 60 minutes for Azure LRO-style acceptance-test setup.
- Rule: Treat quota-sensitive failures separately from missing-deadline failures; if a service has hard subscription quotas or low service limits, prefer sequential acceptance execution patterns or runner-level `-parallel=1` rather than misclassifying those failures as context-deadline issues.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - In target-provider `internal/acceptance/steps.go`, callback helpers invoke the callback with `client.StopContext`, which is not guaranteed to carry a deadline.
  - Azure polling helpers require a deadline-bearing context, so direct use of the callback `ctx` can fail with `the context used must have a deadline attached for polling purposes, but got no deadline`.
  - Durable Task fixes in `durable_task_scheduler_resource_test.go`, `durable_task_hub_resource_test.go`, and `durable_task_retention_policy_resource_test.go` resolved this exact failure mode by wrapping the callback `ctx` with `context.WithTimeout(ctx, 30*time.Minute)` before the poller call.
