# Implementation Compliance Contract

This file is the single source of truth for Go implementation compliance in this repository.

## Consumers

Implementation consumers MUST follow this contract:

- Consumer: `.github/skills/resource-implementation/SKILL.md`
  - Role: Implementer
  - Command: `/resource-implementation`
  - Requires EOF Load: yes
  - Goal: implement or modify Terraform AzureRM provider resources and data sources under `internal/**` while applying `IMPL-*` rules.

- Consumer: `.github/instructions/ai-skill-routing-resource-implementation.instructions.md`
  - Role: Router
  - Requires EOF Load: no
  - Goal: route `internal/**/*.go` work through the implementation contract and the resource-implementation skill.

## Canonical sources of truth (precedence)

Use these sources with the following roles:

- Current workspace contributor guidance
  - `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- This contract
  - Authoritative for implementation compliance, precedence, and core `IMPL-*` rules in this repository.
- Target-provider contributor guidance, when present in the workspace or explicitly fetched as evidence
  - `contributing/README.md`
  - `contributing/topics/**/*.md`

Conflict resolution:

- This contract is authoritative for implementation compliance in this repository.
- Current workspace contributor guidance is authoritative for repo-specific expectations that affect implementation behavior.
- Target-provider contributor guidance is the baseline reference when workspace evidence is insufficient, but this contract may be stricter to reduce drift and ambiguity.
- If target-provider contributor guidance adds or tightens a standard, update this contract so coverage is preserved.
- If a companion implementation guide differs from this contract, follow this contract and update the companion guide to re-align.

## Detailed companion guidance

These files provide worked examples, implementation patterns, and specialized heuristics. They are companion guidance, not an independent compliance layer:

- `.github/instructions/implementation-guide.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/azure-patterns.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/schema-patterns.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/error-patterns.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/provider-guidelines.instructions.md`
- `.github/instructions/code-clarity-enforcement.instructions.md`

## Rule IDs

Rules are identified by stable IDs so the skill and routing layer can reference the same requirements without drifting.

ID format:
- `IMPL-<AREA>-<NNN>`

Areas:
- `EVID` = evidence and verification guardrails
- `WF` = implementation workflow expectations
- `SCHEMA` = schema design and field mapping
- `PATCH` = PATCH/residual-state handling
- `ERR` = error handling and diagnostics
- `TEST` = testing expectations
- `CODE` = code clarity and comment discipline

## Evidence hierarchy

When an implementation claim affects API shape, schema mapping, validation, or severity, use this evidence order:

1. Current workspace contributor guidance and this contract
2. Existing implementation patterns under `internal/**`, especially sibling resources and data sources in the same service
3. Generated or vendored SDK/client models used by the provider
4. Target-provider contributor guidance when present
5. Azure service documentation for semantics only, not for inventing provider-only requirements

If evidence is missing for a behavior-changing claim, do not guess.

# Contract Rules

## Evidence and verification

### IMPL-EVID-001: Do not guess API model structure
- Rule: Do not guess field types, required properties, enum values, or nested shapes when mapping provider schema to Azure SDK/client models.
- Rule: Verify those details from provider code, generated clients, SDK models, or other evidence in the hierarchy above before implementing them.

### IMPL-EVID-002: Use nearby implementations before inventing new patterns
- Rule: When working in a service area, use the closest same-service resource or data source as the primary pattern source for schema shape, CRUD structure, flatten/expand patterns, and timeouts.
- Rule: Do not introduce a new pattern when an existing service-local pattern already covers the problem acceptably.

## Workflow

### IMPL-WF-001: Prefer typed implementations for new work
- Rule: Prefer the typed `internal/sdk` implementation style for new resources and data sources.
- Rule: Use untyped patterns primarily for maintenance of existing untyped implementations unless there is a strong evidence-backed reason to do otherwise.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/best-practices.md` under `Typed vs. Untyped Resources`
  - Upstream contributor guidance there says new Data Sources and Resources should be added as typed implementations

### IMPL-WF-001A: Identify the implementation model before suggesting code
- Rule: Before suggesting implementation code under `internal/**`, identify whether the target is an untyped Plugin SDK resource or data source, a typed `internal/sdk` resource or data source, or a framework-specialized surface.
- Rule: Treat framework-specialized surfaces as a separate model from ordinary typed resources. In this repository, that includes list resources, ephemeral resources, and provider-defined functions.
- Rule: Do not suggest ordinary typed CRUD/resource templates for framework-specialized surfaces.
- Rule: Do not suggest new untyped resource or data source implementations merely because the service package also contains older untyped resources.
- Rule: When the task is maintenance of an existing file, match the model already used by that file unless the task is an explicit migration.
- Rule: When the task is a migration away from `pluginsdk.Retry()`, `pluginsdk.StateChangeConf`, or `WaitForStateContext()`, consult the `custom-poller-migration` skill rather than inventing an ad hoc polling model.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/best-practices.md` under `Typed vs. Untyped Resources`
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` says list resources use the framework list-resource pattern rather than the ordinary managed resource pattern
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-resource.md` says `pluginsdk.StateChangeConf` has been deprecated in favor of custom pollers for the relevant LRO scenarios

### IMPL-WF-002: New resources must include resource identity and list-resource planning
- Rule: For new resources, plan and implement Resource Identity support as a prerequisite for the list resource.
- Rule: For new resources, plan and implement a corresponding list resource by default.
- Rule: If a new resource genuinely cannot support listing because no list API exists or the upstream provider workflow allows an exception, do not silently omit the list resource; explain the reason and use the maintainer-reviewed exception path instead.
- Rule: Treat the upstream `allow-without-list` and `list-not-supported` labels as exception handling, not as the default workflow.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-resource.md` Step 5 and Step 6 says Resource Identity and List Resource implementations are mandatory for all new resources
  - Upstream contributor guidance there says pull requests adding new resources without these will not pass CI checks unless a maintainer applies the `allow-without-list` or `list-not-supported` label
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` says list resource implementations are mandatory for all new resources and are verified by the `enforce-list-resources` CI check

### IMPL-WF-002A: Existing resources retrofitting list support should add the full companion set together
- Rule: When adding list support to an existing resource, plan Resource Identity, the `*_resource_list.go` implementation, service registration, list-query acceptance coverage, and list-resource docs as one workflow.
- Rule: Do not treat list registration, list tests, or list-resource docs as optional follow-up work when the change is explicitly adding list support to an existing resource.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` describes the full list-resource workflow: identity prerequisite, implementation, tests, and docs
  - Upstream provider PR `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm#32192` (`List and identity implementation - azurerm_web_pubsub_custom_certificate`) is a concrete example of retrofitting an existing resource with Resource Identity, list implementation, list tests, and list-resource docs together

### IMPL-WF-002B: Create-time import checks must honor the overwrite feature gate
- Rule: When create logic probes for an existing resource and returns `tf.ImportAsExistsError(...)`, guard that branch with `!meta.(*clients.Client).Features.SkipImportCheckOnCreateAndAllowOverwritingExistingResources`.
- Rule: Do not make the import-as-exists path unconditional when the provider feature flag is configured to allow create-time overwrite behavior.
- Rule: Keep the normal existence-probe semantics: unexpected GET failures still return an error, `404` still permits create, and only the feature-gated existing-resource branch returns `tf.ImportAsExistsError(...)`.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-resource.md` under the Create example says the existing-resource import check should only run unless the user has opted into `skip_import_check_on_create_and_allow_overwriting_existing_resources`.
  - That same upstream example shows the exact guard `if !metadata.Client.Features.SkipImportCheckOnCreateAndAllowOverwritingExistingResources { ... return metadata.ResourceRequiresImport(r.ResourceType(), id) }`, which is the typed-resource equivalent of this rule.

### IMPL-WF-002C: Callback-based create flows must set identity when Resource Identity is supported
- Rule: When a create flow uses a callback-based `...CreateCallbackThenPoll(...)` or equivalent helper and the resource supports Resource Identity, use `sdk.SetIDAndIdentityCallback(meta, &id, d)` or an equivalent callback that sets both the Terraform ID and resource identity during create.
- Rule: Do not use a callback that only sets the Terraform ID, and do not defer identity population until after polling completes, when the resource implements Resource Identity.
- Rule: Non-callback create flows should continue to set identity data immediately after `metadata.SetID(id)` or the untyped equivalent in create.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-resource-identity.md` says Resource Identity data must be set right after the `id` attribute during create to prevent `Missing Resource Identity After Create` errors.
  - That same upstream guide explicitly says that when a resource uses a `CallbackThenPoll` method, the callback should be updated to `SetIDAndIdentityCallBack`, and the untyped example shows `sdk.SetIDAndIdentityCallback(meta, &id, d)`.

### IMPL-WF-003: New resources must include the required documentation companions
- Rule: For new resources, plan and implement the primary resource documentation and the corresponding list-resource documentation when a list resource is required.
- Rule: Place list-resource docs under `website/docs/list-resources/` and treat them as part of the default new-resource workflow, not as an optional follow-up.
- Rule: If a new resource is using the maintainer-reviewed exception path that omits the list resource, explicitly document that exception in the PR rather than silently skipping the list-resource docs.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-resource.md` Step 10 says new resources must add documentation for the resource
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` Step 7 says list resources require manual documentation under `website/docs/list-resources/`
  - The same upstream workflow now makes list resources mandatory for all new resources unless a maintainer applies the documented exception path

### IMPL-WF-004: Ephemeral resources must follow the framework ephemeral pattern
- Rule: Implement provider ephemeral resources under the owning service package as `*_ephemeral.go` using the `sdk.EphemeralResource` pattern.
- Rule: Ephemeral resources should use `Metadata`, `Configure`, `Schema`, and `Open` rather than CRUD lifecycle methods.
- Rule: Register new ephemeral resources through the service `Registration.EphemeralResources()` hook.
- Rule: Treat `website/docs/ephemeral-resources/` docs and `*_ephemeral_test.go` coverage as the required companions for a new ephemeral resource.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/sdk/ephemeral_resource.go`
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/services/keyvault/key_vault_secret_ephemeral.go`
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/services/keyvault/registration.go`
  - Upstream provider docs in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/ephemeral-resources/key_vault_secret.html.markdown`

### IMPL-WF-005: Provider-defined functions must follow the internal provider-function pattern
- Rule: Implement provider-defined functions under `internal/provider/function/` using the `terraform-plugin-framework/function.Function` pattern.
- Rule: Provider-defined functions should implement `Metadata`, `Definition`, and `Run`, and should expose their name, arguments, and return shape through `Definition`.
- Rule: Treat `website/docs/functions/` docs and `internal/provider/function/*_test.go` coverage as the required companions for a new provider-defined function.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/provider/function/parse_resource_id.go`
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/provider/function/normalise_resource_id.go`
  - Upstream provider docs in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/functions/parse_resource_id.html.markdown`
  - Upstream provider docs in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/functions/normalise_resource_id.html.markdown`

## Schema and mapping

### IMPL-SCHEMA-001: Schema requirements must match real behavior
- Rule: `Required`, `Optional`, `Computed`, and validation behavior must reflect real API requirements and established provider conventions.
- Rule: Do not make a field required, optional, or validated more strictly without evidence.

### IMPL-SCHEMA-002: Common field ordering should follow provider conventions
- Rule: When common fields are present, prefer provider ordering patterns such as `name`, `resource_group_name`, and `location` first, with `tags` last.
- Rule: Keep changes consistent with nearby same-service implementations.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-resource.md` says schema fields should place ID fields first, then `location`, with `tags` last
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-data-source.md` applies the same ordering pattern to typed data sources

### IMPL-SCHEMA-003: Generic fallback validators are last-resort, not the target state
- Rule: Treat generic validators such as `validation.StringIsNotEmpty` and `validation.IntAtLeast(...)` as fallback choices only when stronger evidence-backed validation cannot be determined.
- Rule: When evidence establishes real enums, ranges, naming constraints, ID formats, URI formats, or other concrete limits, encode that real validation instead of stopping at non-empty or minimum-only checks.
- Rule: Numeric arguments should define a real valid range when one is known, and string arguments should use pattern, enum, length, ID, or format validation when that behavior is knowable.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Validation` says string arguments must be validated, `StringNotEmpty` is only a minimum, and validation should ideally be more strict
  - Upstream contributor guidance there also says numeric arguments should specify a valid range
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-fields-to-resource.md` says `validation.StringIsNotEmpty` is the minimum only when a stronger validation pattern cannot be determined

### IMPL-SCHEMA-004: Prefer SDK PossibleValues helpers for enum validation unless the real accepted subset is narrower
- Rule: When the SDK package exposes a `PossibleValuesFor...` helper that matches the real accepted enum values for the field, prefer that helper inside `validation.StringInSlice(...)` instead of hardcoding the values manually.
- Rule: If the SDK helper returns values that are broader than what the specific resource, API path, or service behavior actually accepts, define the narrowed validation set from evidence instead of blindly using the full SDK helper output.
- Rule: Do not mix enum values from unrelated services or discriminator types into a field's validation list simply because they appear in the same SDK or provider tree.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Validation` says validation should use the real constraints of the argument rather than weaker or looser checks
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-fields-to-resource.md` says appropriate validation should be added for new properties and stronger patterns should be used when they can be determined

### IMPL-SCHEMA-005: Keep custom schema validation service-local and readable
- Rule: Reuse shared validators such as `commonids.Validate...`, `validation.StringInSlice(...)`, `validation.All(...)`, or other established helpers when they already model the constraint.
- Rule: Keep helper composition inline in the schema only when the validation remains short, field-local, and immediately readable at the schema call site.
- Rule: When introducing a new bespoke validator, or materially updating an existing bespoke validator, extract the validation into that service's `validate/` folder instead of embedding that logic in an anonymous inline `ValidateFunc` closure.
- Rule: Name validator files for the validated subject where practical, for example `validate/{{VALIDATOR_SUBJECT}}.go`, and add the matching unit test file such as `validate/{{VALIDATOR_SUBJECT}}_test.go`.
- Rule: Anonymous inline `ValidateFunc` closures are acceptable only for narrow one-off checks whose full logic is still trivially readable where they are declared. If the closure is reused, materially longer than a short helper composition, or obscures the schema shape, move it into a named validator file under `validate/` when that validator is new or materially updated.
- Rule: Existing legacy validator placement or legacy inline validation outside the changed scope is not, by itself, a migration issue that requires churn-only refactoring.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Current workspace regression fixtures already model service-local validator files under `internal/services/<service>/validate/` with matching test files such as `validate/hostname.go` and `validate/hostname_test.go`
  - Current workspace contributor guidance in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` documents service-local validation artifacts as part of the standard service layout

### IMPL-SCHEMA-006: Normalize resource IDs before setting them into state
- Rule: Always parse resource IDs through their typed parser before persisting them into Terraform state when the value came from API output or other external input that may vary in static-segment casing.
- Rule: This applies to full resource IDs, scoped IDs where the scope must be parsed separately, and IDs returned as nested properties in API responses.
- Rule: Read, import, refresh, and migration paths must treat resource IDs case-insensitively by parsing them through the corresponding typed parser instead of relying on raw string equality against Azure-returned IDs.
- Rule: Use the corresponding typed parser from `hashicorp/go-azure-sdk` or `commonids`, then persist the normalized `.ID()` value rather than the raw string from the API response.
- Rule: When the provider constructs or rewrites a resource ID for state or outbound provider-managed usage, emit the parser or provider canonical `.ID()` form instead of preserving arbitrary casing from external input.
- Rule: Do not set raw API-returned resource ID strings into state when a typed parser exists for that ID shape.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-resource-ids.md` says Azure APIs can return resource IDs with inconsistent casing on static segments and that IDs should be parsed through their typed parser before setting into state to prevent phantom diffs
  - The same upstream guidance explicitly calls out both scoped resource IDs and IDs returned as properties in API responses as in-scope for this normalization rule

### IMPL-SCHEMA-007: Preview fields should not be surfaced until they are GA
- Rule: Do not expose preview-only Azure fields in provider schema until they reach General Availability unless there is explicit, evidence-backed approval to do otherwise.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Preview Fields`
  - That guidance says preview fields should not be supported until they reach GA status

### IMPL-SCHEMA-008: Represent Azure `None`-style defaults as omission/null in schema design
- Rule: When the Azure API uses `None`, `Off`, or `Default` to express the default state, design the Terraform schema so omission/null expresses that default and convert during expand/flatten.
- Rule: Do not require practitioners to configure `None`-style values explicitly when omission already expresses the default behavior.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `The None value or similar`
  - That guidance says omission should map to the API default rather than exposing `None`, `Off`, or `Default` directly

### IMPL-SCHEMA-009: Array schema should use `MinItems` and `MaxItems` when API constraints are known
- Rule: When API constraints define list cardinality, set `MinItems` and `MaxItems` in the Terraform schema instead of leaving cardinality implicit.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Array fields with MinItems and MaxItems`
  - That guidance says array fields should use `MinItems` and `MaxItems` to provide clear validation feedback

### IMPL-SCHEMA-010: Optional `TypeList` blocks with no required nested fields need explicit non-empty validation
- Rule: When a `pluginsdk.TypeList` block has no required nested fields, add conditional validation such as `AtLeastOneOf` or `ExactlyOneOf` so the block cannot be empty.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Validation for TypeList fields with no Required fields`
  - That guidance shows `AtLeastOneOf`-style validation as the pattern for optional list blocks that would otherwise accept empty configuration

### IMPL-SCHEMA-011: Flatten single-property `MaxItems: 1` blocks unless there is evidence to keep the wrapper
- Rule: When a `MaxItems: 1` nested block contains only a single user-meaningful property, prefer flattening it into the parent schema instead of preserving a wrapper block by default.
- Rule: Keep the wrapper block only when there is evidence that additional sibling properties are imminent or that the wrapper carries meaningful user-facing semantics.
- Rule: When deliberately preserving that single-property wrapper, add a short inline comment at the schema site explaining why the block remains unflattened.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Flattening nested properties`
  - That guidance says single-property `MaxItems: 1` wrappers should usually be flattened unless the service team has confirmed more nested properties are imminent

### IMPL-SCHEMA-012: Portal-required fields should normally be `Required` unless API evidence says otherwise
- Rule: When Azure Portal UX marks a field as required, treat that as a strong signal that the Terraform schema should also make it `Required`.
- Rule: Only downgrade such a field to `Optional` when there is concrete evidence that the API accepts omission and the resource still functions correctly without it.
- Rule: Do not treat portal-required markers as infallible API proof, but do not ignore them without evidence-backed justification.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Required fields in Azure Portal vs API documentation`
  - That guidance says fields marked as required in the Azure Portal should be `Required` in Terraform unless the API accepts omission and still functions

### IMPL-SCHEMA-013: Use `GetRawConfig()` in `CustomizeDiff` when validation must distinguish configured values from unknown or zero values
- Rule: In `CustomizeDiff`, prefer `GetRawConfig()` over `diff.Get(...)` or decoded zero values when validation must distinguish unset fields from known-after-apply or Go zero values.
- Rule: Use this pattern for cross-field validation where unknown values would otherwise collapse to zero values and trigger false positives.
- Rule: When `CustomizeDiff` or other diff-time validation traverses nested raw `cty.Value` config, call `IsKnown()` before `LengthInt()`, `AsValueSlice()`, `AsValueMap()`, `Index()`, or other shape-inspection methods. If a value is unknown, defer validation and return `nil` rather than treating the value as empty or letting shape inspection panic.
- Rule: Prefer direct `diff.Get(...)` access for required values whose presence is guaranteed by schema and where no configured-versus-unknown distinction is needed.
- Rule: Do not use `pointer.FromEnum(...)` or `pointer.ToEnum[...]` with `diff.Get(...)`, `GetRawConfig()`, decoded schema maps, or other Terraform values inside `CustomizeDiff`; reserve those helpers for the SDK or API enum-pointer boundary.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/best-practices.md` under `Consider the use of GetRawConfig() in CustomizeDiff to handle known-after-apply values` establishes `GetRawConfig()` as the baseline pattern when `d.Get()` or decoded values would make unknowns look unset
  - Terraform unknown values are common during planning, especially in `GetRawConfig()`-based `CustomizeDiff` validation
  - Raw `cty.Value` traversal without `IsKnown()` can panic when `LengthInt()`, `AsValueSlice()`, or similar shape-inspection methods are called on unknown values

### IMPL-SCHEMA-014: Prefer marketed or portal terminology over raw API names when that improves the Terraform UX
- Rule: When the Azure Portal or other primary user-facing Azure surface uses a materially clearer name than the REST API property, prefer that marketed or portal terminology in Terraform schema naming unless there is evidence that another surface is the better user anchor.
- Rule: Do not copy awkward REST property names into public schema purely for one-to-one fidelity when a more recognizable Azure-facing name better matches user expectations.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Prefer Azure Portal terminology when it differs significantly from the REST API`
  - That guidance says users should be able to correlate Terraform configuration with the portal experience and should align with Azure CLI instead when the portal is not the primary experience

### IMPL-SCHEMA-015: Group semantically related arguments when a flat schema would scatter one conceptual setting family
- Rule: When a resource has a large set of arguments and the Azure Portal or CLI groups a subset into a coherent settings area, prefer introducing a Terraform block or equivalent grouped shape when that materially reduces cognitive load.
- Rule: Do not preserve a fully flat schema by default when grouping the related settings would make the Terraform surface clearer without hiding real API semantics.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Group semantically related arguments`
  - That guidance says portal or CLI sectioning can justify grouping related Terraform settings to reduce cognitive load even though arguments are otherwise commonly ordered alphabetically

### IMPL-SCHEMA-016: Avoid ambiguous collection-shaped schemas and name configured blocks by their real cardinality
- Rule: When an Azure API models repeated items as a list but multiple entries could target the same semantic slot, redesign the Terraform schema to eliminate ambiguity instead of letting configuration order imply which entry wins.
- Rule: Use singular names for blocks that represent one configured object at a time, even when the underlying schema uses `TypeList` or another repeated container.
- Rule: Use plural names for lists of primitive values and for computed-only collections that return multiple values rather than a single configured object.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/schema-design-considerations.md` under `Eliminate ambiguity in collection-typed arguments`
  - That guidance says ambiguous collection-based shapes should be redesigned so the Terraform schema does not permit multiple conflicting values for the same conceptual slot
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-naming.md` under `Singular and Plural Block Property Naming Conventions`
  - That guidance says configured blocks should generally use singular names, while primitive lists and computed multi-value collections should generally use plural names

## PATCH and residual state

### IMPL-PATCH-001: Explicitly disable features in PATCH flows
- Rule: When Azure PATCH behavior preserves omitted values, do not rely on omission to disable a feature.
- Rule: Return complete structures with explicit disabled state where needed to clear residual state reliably.

## Error handling

### IMPL-ERR-001: Use provider-standard error wording
- Rule: Error messages should be lowercase, descriptive, and free of contractions.
- Rule: Wrap field names and important user-visible values in backticks.
- Rule: Use `%+v` for underlying errors when wrapping provider or SDK failures.
- Rule: Use `errors.New(...)` for static errors that do not wrap an underlying error and do not require formatting.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-errors.md` for lowercase wrapped errors, `%+v`, and `errors.New(...)`
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-new-resource.md` requiring argument names in error messages to be wrapped in backticks

### IMPL-ERR-002: Do not wrap comprehensive ID parser errors with redundant context
- Rule: When a resource ID parser or validator already returns a comprehensive, user-facing error message, prefer returning that error directly instead of wrapping it with extra `parsing`, `flattening`, or field-name context.
- Rule: Add wrapping context only when it contributes materially new information that the parser error does not already provide.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Maintainer review guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm` PR `#31957` comment `discussion_r3137015087`: `since the id parser gives us a comprehensive error message, we don't need any other message with this`
  - The suggested maintainer change there replaces a redundant wrapped parser error with `return results, err`

## Testing

### IMPL-TEST-001: Update tests when implementation behavior changes
- Rule: Add or adjust tests when schema behavior, resource behavior, or API mapping changes materially.
- Rule: Do not leave implementation changes untested when existing test patterns can cover them.

### IMPL-TEST-002: Prefer ImportStep plus existence checks when appropriate
- Rule: In acceptance tests, prefer `ImportStep()` for validation and `ExistsInAzure` for existence checks when that pattern fits the resource or data source.

### IMPL-TEST-003: Provider feature-flagged CRUD branch coverage
- Rule: When implementation changes modify behavior behind a provider-level features block setting and that setting changes create, update, delete, import, overwrite, or destroy semantics, evaluate whether targeted coverage is needed for the changed non-default branch.
- Rule: When that branch is testable with existing harness patterns, add the smallest focused test that proves the non-default behavior instead of relying only on the default lifecycle matrix.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Feature-gated CRUD branches can leave default-path acceptance tests green while the non-default behavior remains unproven.
  - The provider acceptance harness already includes client callback patterns suitable for preparing pre-existing remote state when needed.

## Code clarity

### IMPL-CODE-001: Avoid unnecessary comments
- Rule: Prefer self-documenting code.
- Rule: Add comments only when documenting non-obvious Azure quirks, Azure SDK workarounds or limitations, complex business logic that still cannot be made self-explanatory after refactoring, or non-obvious state-management patterns.
- Rule: Do not add comments for variable assignments, struct initialization, standard Terraform or Go patterns, self-explanatory function calls, obvious field mappings, or routine error-handling and nil-check flow.
- Rule: When a comment is added, prefer improving naming, extraction, or structure first and use the comment only for the irreducible context that remains.

### IMPL-CODE-002: Avoid redundant lifecycle/provider logging by default
- Rule: Do not add generic resource lifecycle logging such as `Import check for %s`, `Creating %s`, `Reading %s`, `Updating %s`, or `Deleting %s` when those messages only duplicate Terraform core or provider-native logging.
- Rule: Add provider-side logging only when it contributes unique diagnostic value that is not already present in the existing Terraform/provider log stream.
- Rule: If broad, consistent lifecycle logging is desired, prefer solving that at the shared SDK or framework layer rather than adding ad hoc per-resource log lines.
- Rule: This does not prohibit targeted not-found or removing-from-state diagnostics when they are part of established provider behavior and add distinct debugging value.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Maintainer review feedback in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm` PR `#32194` comment `discussion_r3256881651` says generic lifecycle logging is redundant with Terraform core native logging and should be removed
  - Maintainer PR `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm#32423` (`provider: remove antiquated lifecycle logging patterns`) states lifecycle logging was inconsistent, implemented only by a minority of resources, and should likely live in the SDK if desired consistently
  - Maintainer follow-up discussion in PR `#32423` keeps the standardized not-found/removing-from-state diagnostic as the narrow acceptable exception
