# Docs Compliance Contract

This file is the **single source of truth** for documentation compliance rules in this repository.

## Consumers

Two independent workflows MUST follow this contract:

- Consumer: `.github/skills/docs-writer/SKILL.md`
  - Role: Writer
  - Command: `/docs-writer`
  - Requires EOF Load: yes
  - Goal: produce docs that satisfy all applicable rules in this contract.
  - Output format is not prescribed by this contract.

- Consumer: `.github/prompts/code-review-docs.prompt.md`
  - Role: Auditor
  - Command: `/code-review-docs`
  - Requires EOF Load: yes
  - Goal: detect and report violations of rules in this contract.
  - Output structure is defined by the prompt, but the rules enforced MUST come from this contract.

## Canonical sources of truth (precedence)

Use these sources with the following roles:
- Upstream contributor standards in the target repo: `contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md`
  - Baseline source for provider documentation standards.
  - Applicable upstream standards MUST be represented in this contract.
- This contract: `.github/instructions/docs-compliance-contract.instructions.md`
  - Authoritative compliance rules for this repository.
  - Audits and edits MUST enforce this contract.
- This repo’s docs instruction file: `.github/instructions/documentation-guidelines.instructions.md`
  - Companion guidance only.
  - May explain workflows, provide examples, and add heuristics, but MUST NOT weaken or contradict this contract.

Conflict resolution:
- This contract is authoritative for documentation compliance in this repository.
- Upstream contributor standards are the baseline reference, but this contract MAY extend or be stricter than upstream to close gaps and prevent run-to-run drift.
- If upstream contributor standards add or tighten a standard, update this contract so coverage is preserved.
- If upstream contributor standards explicitly contradict a contract rule:
  - Follow the contract for this repository’s audits/edits.
  - Treat the discrepancy as a signal to re-evaluate the rule and (if appropriate) update either the contract or the local docs instructions.
- If the companion guidance differs from this contract, follow this contract and update the guidance to re-align.

## Rule IDs

Rules are identified by stable IDs so both the writer and auditor can reference the same requirement without drifting.

Contract example guidance:
- Examples in this contract should be synthetic and generic (for example `azurerm_foo_bar`) unless a real identifier is strictly required to explain a deterministic algorithm.

ID format:
- `DOCS-<AREA>-<NNN>`

Areas:
- `EX` = examples (Terraform code blocks in `Example*` sections)
- `NOTE` = notes (`->` / `~>` / `!>` markers, required notes)
- `ARG` = arguments reference (ordering, parity)
- `ATTR` = attributes reference (ordering, coverage)
- `OBS` = observation-only guidance (non-blocking findings)
- `LANG` = language quality (typos, grammar)
- `FMT` = formatting conventions (backticks, canonical intro lines)
- `FM` = frontmatter
- `STRUCT` = required sections + section order
- `IMP` = import instructions/examples (resources)
- `SHAPE` = schema shape parity (block vs inline vs map)
- `WORD` = wording conventions (ForceNew, enum phrasing)
- `TIMEOUT` = timeouts formatting/readability
- `LINK` = link hygiene
- `SEC` = secret/material exposure
- `DEPR` = next-major (vNext) deprecations
- `EVID` = evidence/verification guardrails

## Rule provenance

Some rules in this contract come from published upstream standards, while others are inferred from repeated maintainer review behavior or added locally to reduce audit drift.

Use the following provenance labels when a rule needs extra source clarity:

- `Published upstream standard`: explicitly documented by upstream contributor or provider documentation standards.
- `Inferred maintainer convention`: not clearly codified upstream, but supported by repeated maintainer review guidance, accepted maintainer rewrites, or other factual review evidence.
- `Local safeguard`: a repository-local rule added to reduce drift, ambiguity, or run-to-run inconsistency even when upstream documentation is silent or less explicit.

Provenance rollout is incremental. New rules and touched ambiguous rules should include provenance notes first; older rules may be backfilled over time.

## Evidence hierarchy

When a rule requires behavioral claims, use this evidence order:
- Terraform schema + provider implementation (`internal/**`)
- Vendored SDK constants/models in this repo (`vendor/**`) when referenced by validation logic (enums, cipher suites, SDK constants)
- Existing provider docs (tone/phrasing patterns)
- Azure docs for semantics only (service behavior/background), not for provider validation/requirements

If you cannot locate workspace evidence for a claim that affects validity, do not guess.

# Contract Rules

## Evidence & guardrails

### DOCS-EVID-001: Do not guess when evidence is required
- **Rule**: If a compliance-relevant claim cannot be backed by schema/implementation evidence (for example example value validity, import ID shape, conditional requirements), do not guess.
- **Writer behavior**: prefer removing/avoiding the unproven claim, or locate evidence.
- **Auditor behavior**: record an Issue stating evidence could not be proven.

---

## Observations

### DOCS-OBS-001: Prefer boolean `*_enabled` over string toggles (observation-only)
- **Rule**: When schema evidence shows an argument is a `TypeString` enum that is effectively a boolean toggle (for example allowed values `Enabled`/`Disabled`, `Enable`/`Disable`, or `On`/`Off`), prefer a boolean `*_enabled` field.
- **Tri-state nuance**: if a third value exists (for example `None`), a string enum may be justified.
- **Auditor behavior**: report as an **Observation** only (not an Issue), unless the docs are incorrect relative to the current schema.
- **Docs behavior**: documentation MUST describe the schema as it exists today. This observation must NOT be used to justify rewriting docs to a hypothetical boolean field; it should only surface as an observation about schema design.

---

## Frontmatter

### DOCS-FM-001: Required frontmatter keys
- **Rule**: Docs pages must include required frontmatter keys as defined by repo standards.
- **Minimum** (as enforced today): `subcategory`, `layout`, `page_title`, `description`.

### DOCS-FM-007: Frontmatter must appear at the beginning of the file
- **Rule**: Resource, data source, list-resource, ephemeral-resource, and function reference docs MUST include YAML frontmatter at the beginning of the documentation file.

### DOCS-FM-003: Resource `page_title` canonical format
- **Scope**: resource docs under `website/docs/r/**`.

### DOCS-FM-008: List resource `page_title` canonical format
- **Scope**: list-resource docs under `website/docs/list-resources/**`.
- **Rule**: List-resource docs MUST use the canonical YAML `page_title` format: `page_title: "Azure Resource Manager: azurerm_<name>"`.

### DOCS-FM-004: Frontmatter `description` must match the doc type summary style
- **Rule**: The YAML `description` MUST be a short summary sentence matching the doc type.
- **Rule**: Resource docs MUST use the canonical resource summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Manages ...`).
- **Rule**: Data source docs MUST use the canonical data source summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Gets information about an existing ...`).
- **Rule**: List-resource docs MUST use the canonical list-resource summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Lists ... resources.`).
- **Rule**: Ephemeral-resource docs MUST use the canonical ephemeral-resource summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Use this to access information about an existing ...`).
- **Rule**: Function docs MUST use the canonical function summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Takes ...` or another implementation-backed function behavior sentence).

### DOCS-FM-005: `subcategory` must match the service website category
- **Rule**: The YAML `subcategory` value MUST match the website category used for that service in the target provider repo.
- **Rule**: When the target repo exposes an allowed-category list or existing service docs, use that evidence instead of guessing.
- **Rule**: If multiple valid website categories exist for the same service, match the existing documentation for that service.
- **Rule**: Function docs may use an empty-string `subcategory` when that matches the existing function docs in the target provider repo.
- **Guardrail**: if the correct category cannot be proven from workspace evidence or the target repo standards, do not guess (see `DOCS-EVID-001`).

### DOCS-FM-006: `layout` must be `azurerm`
- **Rule**: The YAML `layout` value for resource, data source, list-resource, ephemeral-resource, and function reference docs MUST be `azurerm`.

### DOCS-STRUCT-004: Document title heading by doc type
- **Resources** (`website/docs/r/**`): the top-level heading must be `# azurerm_<name>`.
- **Data sources** (`website/docs/d/**`): the top-level heading must be `# Data Source: azurerm_<name>`.

- **Rule**: Resource docs MUST use the canonical resource summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Manages ...`).
- **Rule**: Data source docs MUST use the canonical data source summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Gets information about ...`).
- **Rule**: List-resource docs MUST use the canonical list-resource summary style defined by `DOCS-WORD-003` (for example `Lists ... resources.`).

### DOCS-STRUCT-008: Function runtime support note
- **Scope**: function docs under `website/docs/functions/**`.
- **Rule**: Function docs MUST include the exact runtime-support note `~> **Note:** Provider-defined functions are supported in Terraform 1.8 and later, and are available from version 4.0 of the provider.` immediately below the title and before the summary sentence.

---

## Formatting

### DOCS-FMT-001: Canonical section intro lines
- Under `## Arguments Reference`: `The following arguments are supported:`
- Under `## Attributes Reference`: `In addition to the Arguments listed above - the following Attributes are exported:`
- Under `## Argument Reference` for list-resource docs: `This list resource supports the following arguments:`
- Under `## Argument Reference` for ephemeral-resource docs: `The following arguments are supported:`
- Under `## Attributes Reference` for ephemeral-resource docs: `The following attributes are exported:`

### DOCS-FMT-002: Backticks for arguments and values
- **Rule**: Always use backticks around argument/attribute names (for example `resource_group_name`).
- **Rule**: Always use backticks around specific values/enums (for example `Standard`, `Premium`).

### DOCS-FMT-003: Use the most specific code fence language
- **Rule**: Code fences should use the most specific language that matches the snippet.
- **Rule**: Terraform configuration snippets MUST use `hcl` fences; do not use `terraform` fences for HCL configuration.

---

## Import (resources)

### DOCS-IMP-001: Import example correctness
- **Scope**: resources only.
- **Rule**: Import instruction/example must match the provider importer/parser ID shape.
- **Rule**: If the import ID shape cannot be proven from code, do not guess (see DOCS-EVID-001).

### DOCS-IMP-002: Import section must include standard wording and example
- **Scope**: resources only.
- **Rule**: Import section MUST include a resource-specific sentence of the form:
  - `A <Resource Name> can be imported using the `resource id`, e.g.`
  - Use `An` instead of `A` when `<Resource Name>` starts with a vowel.
  - `<Resource Name>` should match the resource name used in the page’s summary sentence (see `DOCS-WORD-003`) and should be singular.
- **Rule**: Import section MUST include a `shell` fenced block containing a `terraform import <resource_address> <resource_id>` example.

### DOCS-IMP-003: Import example determinism (stubs and placeholders)
- **Scope**: resources only.
- **Rule**: The import command MUST use the `.example` instance name, for example: `terraform import azurerm_<type>.example <resource_id>`.
- **Rule**: The subscription ID in the example resource ID MUST be the all-zeros stub: `00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000`.
- **Rule**: Name-like placeholder segments in the example resource ID MUST be mechanically derived from the preceding path key to avoid AI-invented values.
  - **Algorithm**:
    1) when an ARM ID path includes a key/value pair like `.../<key>/<value>...`, set `<value>` to `<singular(key)>1`
    2) `singular(key)` is `key` with a trailing `s` removed when present
    3) preserve the key's casing in the derived name (for example `customDomains` -> `customDomain1`)
  - **Special-cases**:
    - `resourceGroups/<value>` MUST use `resourceGroup1`

---

## Schema shape parity

### DOCS-SHAPE-001: Block vs inline vs map parity
- **Rule**: Docs must match the schema's structural shape.
- If schema defines a nested block (commonly `TypeList`/`TypeSet` with `Elem: &Resource{Schema: ...}` and `MaxItems: 1`), docs must describe a `${block}` block and list nested fields under a "A `${block}` block supports the following:" section.
- If schema defines a scalar/inline field (`TypeString`/`TypeBool`/`TypeInt`/etc.), docs must not describe it as a block and must not document nested subfields.
- If schema defines a map (`TypeMap`), docs must describe it as a map (not a block).

### DOCS-SHAPE-005: Primitive list/set parity
- **Rule**: If schema defines a list/set of primitives (for example `TypeList`/`TypeSet` with `Elem: &schema.Schema{Type: schema.TypeString}` or other primitive types), docs must describe it as a list/set of values.
- **Rule**: Docs must not describe a primitive list/set as a nested block with named subfields.

### DOCS-SHAPE-002: Block placement and phrasing by section
- **Rule**: Block arguments belong under `## Arguments Reference`.
  - Bullet: ``* `<block>` - (Optional) A `<block>` block as defined below.`` (use `(Required)` when required)
  - Subsection heading: `A `<block>` block supports the following:`
- **Rule**: Block attributes belong under `## Attributes Reference`.
  - Bullet: ``* `<block>` - A `<block>` block as defined below.``
  - Subsection heading: `A `<block>` block exports the following:`

### DOCS-SHAPE-003: Indefinite article for block headings
- **Rule**: Use `An` when the block name starts with `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, or `u` (after stripping backticks); otherwise use `A`.

### DOCS-SHAPE-004: Block subsections placement and ordering
- **Rule**: Block subsections must appear after all top-level bullets for their section.
- **Rule**: When multiple block subsections exist within a section, they must be ordered alphabetically by block name.

### DOCS-SHAPE-006: Nested block argument ordering (Arguments Reference)
- **Scope**: nested field bullets inside a block subsection under `## Arguments Reference` (i.e. under `A `<block>` block supports the following:`).
- **Rule**: Nested fields MUST be ordered as:
  1) required nested arguments first (alphabetical)
  2) optional nested arguments next (alphabetical)
  3) `tags` always last when present
- **Rule**: Required vs optional MUST be derived from the nested schema (do not guess).
- **Rule**: Any note blocks that apply to a nested field MUST remain directly attached to that field when reordering.

### DOCS-SHAPE-007: Directional block references must match subsection position
- **Scope**: block references inside block subsections (for example nested bullets that describe another documented block subsection in the same page section).
- **Rule**: When directional wording is used for a referenced block subsection in the same section, `as defined above` MUST be used when the referenced block subsection appears earlier in that section, and `as defined below` MUST be used when the referenced block subsection appears later in that section.
- **Rule**: This does not change the canonical top-level block bullet pattern under `## Arguments Reference` or `## Attributes Reference`, which continues to use `as defined below`.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to make subsection cross-references deterministic after block reordering
  - Enforced by this repository's docs contract rather than a clearly codified upstream wording rule

### DOCS-SHAPE-008: Block subsection separators
- **Scope**: `## Arguments Reference` and `## Attributes Reference`.
- **Rule**: Insert `---` immediately before the first block subsection heading that follows the top-level bullet list.
- **Rule**: Insert `---` between adjacent block subsections.
- **Rule**: Do not insert `---` between ordinary top-level argument or attribute bullets.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to keep nested block sections visually stable and patch-ready during audits
  - Companion guidance and audits in this repository rely on this separator pattern for consistent rewrites

---

## Examples

### DOCS-EX-000: Examples must be functional
- **Rule**: Examples MUST be functional for their intended scenario.
- **Rule**: Resource examples must be functional and self-contained enough that a user can copy/paste them and run `terraform plan` without errors.
- **Rule**: Data source examples must be functional for an existing-object lookup scenario and do not need to declare the looked-up object in the same example.
- **Rule**: List-resource examples must be functional for a list query scenario and use Terraform `list` blocks rather than `resource` or `data` blocks for the primary example.
- **Rule**: Ephemeral-resource examples must be functional for an ephemeral read scenario and use Terraform `ephemeral` blocks rather than `resource` or `data` blocks for the primary documented object.
- **Rule**: Function examples must be functional for a provider-defined function scenario and call the documented function through `provider::azurerm::<name>(...)`.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Examples`
  - That guidance says examples MUST be functional and should not error when a user runs `terraform plan`
  - Proposed clarification in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm` PR `#32299` separates resource examples from data source lookup examples and explains that data source examples may assume the looked-up object already exists

### DOCS-EX-001: Example Terraform config fences must be `hcl`
- **Scope**: fenced Terraform configuration blocks under headings that start with `Example` (e.g. `## Example Usage`, `## Example ...`).
- **Rule**: Terraform configuration examples MUST use fenced blocks labeled `hcl`.
- **Out of scope**: code blocks outside `Example*` headings.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Code Fences`
  - That guidance says Terraform configuration should use `hcl` code fences and not `terraform`

### DOCS-EX-002: Example Terraform CLI fences must be `shell` or `shell-session`
- **Scope**: fenced CLI blocks under headings that start with `Example`.
- **Rule**: CLI examples MUST use `shell` (single command) or `shell-session` (prompt/output transcript).

### DOCS-EX-003: Resource examples must be self-contained
- **Scope**: resource docs under `website/docs/r/**`.
- **Rule**: Every Terraform reference used in a resource Example configuration (`resource`, `data`, `module`, expressions like `azurerm_*.*`, `data.*.*`, `module.*`) MUST be declared somewhere on the same doc page.
- **Allowed pattern**: define shared resources in `## Example Usage`, reference them from other examples on the same page.
- **Remediation rule**: if an Example is not self-contained, fix it by adding the missing `resource`/`data`/`module` declarations to the page (typically in `## Example Usage`), not by deleting the Example section/block.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to stop audits from resolving broken examples by deleting Example content or leaving undeclared references behind
  - Reflected in this repository's docs review workflow for copy/pasteable examples
  - Scoped to resource docs because the upstream clarification in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm` PR `#32299` distinguishes resource examples from data source lookup examples

### DOCS-EX-020: Example self-containedness must be transitive
- **Scope**: resource Example Terraform configuration blocks (`## Example*`) in `website/docs/r/**`.
- **Rule**: When you add missing `resource`/`data`/`module` declarations to satisfy `DOCS-EX-003`, you MUST ensure the resulting Example is fully runnable:
  - Newly added declarations MUST include all schema-required arguments/blocks for those objects (see `DOCS-EX-011`).
  - Any Terraform references introduced by the newly added declarations MUST also be declared on the same doc page.
  - Repeat until there are no undeclared references (transitive closure).
- **Rule**: Do not stop after fixing only the first-level missing reference if doing so leaves the Example non-functional.
- **Guardrail**: if you cannot complete transitive self-containedness without guessing due to missing workspace evidence, record an Observation and cite `DOCS-EVID-001`.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to prevent partial self-containedness fixes that still leave Example blocks unrunnable
  - Enforced for deterministic docs audits in this repository

### DOCS-EX-021: Preserve reference semantics in examples
- **Scope**: resource Example Terraform configuration blocks (`## Example*`) in `website/docs/r/**`.
- **Rule**: Do not change an argument value from a Terraform reference to a literal (or from a literal to a reference) as a convenience workaround unless schema/implementation evidence proves the replacement is correct and intended.
  - Examples of Terraform references: `azurerm_*.example.*`, `data.*.*`, `module.*`.
  - Examples of problematic "convenience" rewrites: replacing a reference with a plausible-looking hostname/domain string, or removing a reference entirely.
- **Default behavior**: preserve the original reference intent and make the Example self-contained by declaring the referenced object(s) per `DOCS-EX-003`/`DOCS-EX-020`.
- **Guardrail**: if evidence is insufficient to justify a reference↔literal change, do not guess; record an Observation per `DOCS-EVID-001`.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to stop Example repairs from inventing plausible-looking literal values that drift from real provider behavior
  - Works with `DOCS-EVID-001` to keep example rewrites evidence-based

### DOCS-EX-019: Do not replace Terraform references with invented literals
- **Scope**: resource Example Terraform configuration blocks (`## Example*`) in `website/docs/r/**`.
- **Rule**: When fixing Example self-containedness or undeclared references, you MUST NOT replace Terraform references (for example `azurerm_*.example.*`, `data.*.*`, `module.*`) with invented literal string values (for example `"example.foo.azure.com"`) as a shortcut.
- **Required remediation**: declare the missing referenced `resource`/`data`/`module` blocks on the same doc page (see `DOCS-EX-003`).
- **Exception**: you may replace a reference with a literal only when schema/implementation evidence proves the literal value form and constraints deterministically and the Example is explicitly teaching a literal value scenario (see `DOCS-EX-010`/`DOCS-EX-016`). Otherwise record an Observation per `DOCS-EVID-001`.
- **Independence**: this rule is independent of `DOCS-EX-004`/`DOCS-EX-018`; preserving existing required `depends_on` and example-adjacent notes remains mandatory.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added after repeated docs-audit failure modes where undeclared references were replaced with invented strings instead of real declarations
  - Reinforces `DOCS-EX-003` and `DOCS-EX-021` with a concrete prohibited shortcut

### DOCS-EX-004: Preserve required `depends_on` verbatim when rewriting examples
- **Rule**: If an existing example contains `depends_on = [...]`, it MUST be preserved with the same referenced objects when rewriting that example.
- **Rule**: If prose/note explicitly requires `depends_on` referencing specific objects, the example MUST include that `depends_on` exactly (do not weaken it).
- **How to fix self-containedness**: add missing referenced resources; do not delete/simplify `depends_on`.
- **Hard rule**: if `depends_on` references objects not declared on the page, you MUST add the missing declarations rather than removing those entries.
- **Non-negotiable**: do not remove or shorten an existing `depends_on` to make an example "simpler".
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to preserve sequencing semantics already present in existing examples and notes
  - Prevents audits or rewrites from simplifying examples in ways that silently remove required ordering

### DOCS-EX-017: Do not introduce net-new `depends_on` without evidence
- **Rule**: Do not introduce `depends_on` in examples unless schema/implementation evidence proves ordering is required, or the docs are explicitly teaching an ordering constraint.
- **Guardrail**: If ordering requirements cannot be proven from schema/implementation evidence, do not add `depends_on` (see DOCS-EVID-001).
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to prevent speculative example fixes that add `depends_on` without proof
  - Works with `DOCS-EVID-001` to keep ordering guidance evidence-based

### DOCS-EX-018: Preserve example-adjacent notes when rewriting examples
- **Scope**: notes immediately above or directly associated with a Terraform configuration block under headings that start with `Example`.
- **Rule**: If an `Example*` section contains a note that describes required sequencing/validation (for example, it claims a specific `depends_on` is required), you MUST preserve that note when rewriting the example.
- **Rule**: If you change the example in a way that would make the note inaccurate, rewrite the note so it remains correct and evidence-based (do not delete it to avoid the obligation).
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to stop rewrites from dropping neighboring notes that explain why the Example is structured a certain way
  - Keeps Example code and surrounding explanatory notes aligned during audits

### DOCS-EX-005: Examples must not hard-code secrets
- **Rule**: Examples must not contain passwords/tokens/keys/client secrets/private keys/SAS tokens.
- **Fix**: replace literals with `var.<name>` or similar non-secret placeholders.

### DOCS-EX-006: Example minimalism
- **Rule**: Examples should include only required arguments by default.
- **Exception**: include optional arguments only when required for validity (schema/diff-time constraints) or to demonstrate the example’s stated scenario.

### DOCS-EX-007: Example naming convention (nit-level)
- **Rule**: Where feasible, name-like string values should start with `example-` (resources) or `existing-` (data sources).
- **Severity**: drift from this convention is a **nit** and must not, by itself, make a doc review invalid.
- **Auditor behavior**: when this convention is violated and a deterministic rename can be derived from workspace evidence (see `DOCS-EX-015`/`DOCS-EX-016`), report it as a low-priority Issue with a concrete fix step.

Additional auditor behavior (deterministic suffix; nit-level):
- Even when a name-like value already uses the correct prefix (`example-`/`existing-`), if it does not match the deterministic `DOCS-EX-015` type-derived value, the auditor SHOULD still recommend renaming it to the type-derived value when (and only when) schema/implementation evidence proves the type-derived value is valid for that specific field (`DOCS-EX-016`).
- If that validity cannot be proven from workspace evidence, do not guess; record an Observation per `DOCS-EVID-001`.

### DOCS-EX-008: Examples must not include `terraform` or `provider` blocks
- **Scope**: resource docs under `website/docs/r/**`, data source docs under `website/docs/d/**`, list-resource docs under `website/docs/list-resources/**`, and ephemeral-resource docs under `website/docs/ephemeral-resources/**`.
- **Rule**: Example Terraform configuration blocks for those doc types must not include a `terraform { ... }` block or a `provider { ... }` block.
- **Rule**: Function docs under `website/docs/functions/**` may include a `provider "azurerm"` block when needed to make the provider-defined function example runnable.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Examples`
  - That guidance says resource and data source examples should not define a `terraform` or `provider` block

### DOCS-EX-009: Example HCL must be syntactically valid
- **Rule**: Example Terraform configuration blocks must be valid HCL (balanced braces, correct block structure, no obvious truncation).

### DOCS-EX-010: Example values must satisfy schema/implementation constraints
- **Rule**: Example values must satisfy naming/value constraints expressed by schema validations (`ValidateFunc`, enum validations like `validation.StringInSlice`, etc.) and any clearly enforceable diff-time rules.
- **Rule**: When local implementation-backed or acceptance-test-backed example evidence exists for an Example's field names, object keys, map keys, casing, or literal shape, the docs Example MUST preserve that proven spelling/casing/shape rather than inventing an alternative derived from SDK or API naming.
- **Rule**: For map or object literals shown in docs Examples, treat acceptance-test-backed HCL and implementation-backed example HCL as authoritative evidence for user-facing key casing when those examples are present in the current review or writing scope.
- **Rule**: When the docs Example and local acceptance-test-backed or implementation-backed HCL both demonstrate the same user-facing Terraform argument as a map or object literal, compare the keys directly for spelling and casing parity. A mismatch such as `FooBar` versus `fooBar` on that same argument is invalid even when both spellings might look plausible in isolation.
- **Rule**: For this parity check, acceptance-test-backed HCL is sufficient evidence of the intended user-facing key names for the same argument; do not require separate API-layer proof before treating the docs mismatch as invalid.
- **Rule**: If validity cannot be proven from schema/implementation evidence, do not guess compliant values (see DOCS-EVID-001).

### DOCS-EX-011: Examples must include all schema required arguments
- **Rule**: Each Example Terraform configuration block for the primary object being documented must include all schema required arguments/blocks for that object.
- **Rationale**: examples must be copy/pasteable and should not fail due to missing required inputs.

### DOCS-EX-012: Example sections must remain copy/pasteable Terraform
- **Rule**: Do not delete or convert "Example …" Terraform configuration blocks into prose. An `Example*` section must contain copy/pasteable Terraform configuration.
- **Rule**: Do not remove an `Example*` section (or its fenced Terraform configuration block) as a remediation for self-containedness or other example failures.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to prevent audits from resolving broken examples by collapsing them into prose
  - Keeps `Example*` sections aligned with the repository's copy/pasteable-example expectation

### DOCS-EX-013: Example instance name convention (style)
- **Rule**: Generally, the resource/data source/list-resource/ephemeral-resource instance name in examples should be `example`.
- **Severity**: deviations are typically style-level and should not, by themselves, make a page invalid.

### DOCS-EX-014: Avoid multiple examples when possible
- **Rule**: Avoid multiple examples unless a specific configuration is particularly difficult to configure.
- **Rule**: If many complex examples are needed, prefer using the repository `examples/` folder instead of expanding the docs page.
- **Rule**: List-resource docs may use multiple examples when they are showing distinct query scopes such as subscription-wide and narrowed query configurations.

### DOCS-EX-022: Data source examples should demonstrate existing-object lookups
- **Scope**: data source docs under `website/docs/d/**`.
- **Rule**: Data source examples MUST demonstrate the intended lookup scenario for an existing object.
- **Rule**: Data source examples may assume the looked-up object already exists and do not need to declare the backing resource in the same example.
- **Rule**: Data source examples should include only the arguments needed to identify the looked-up object.
- **Rule**: Do not add resource scaffolding solely to create the lookup target in a data source example.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Examples`
  - Proposed clarification in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm` PR `#32299` adds an explicit resource-example versus data-source-example split and says data source examples may assume the looked-up object already exists

### DOCS-EX-023: List-resource examples must demonstrate list queries
- **Scope**: list-resource docs under `website/docs/list-resources/**`.
- **Rule**: The primary example blocks in list-resource docs MUST use Terraform `list "azurerm_<name>" "example"` syntax for the documented list resource.
- **Rule**: List-resource examples should demonstrate the intended query scopes of the list resource, such as the default subscription-wide query and any supported narrowed query configuration.
- **Rule**: Do not model the primary example as a `resource` or `data` block when the page is documenting a list resource.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` under `Add documentation for this List Resource`
  - The upstream example there uses `list "azurerm_network_profile" "example"` blocks and shows multiple query-scope examples for the list resource

### DOCS-EX-024: Ephemeral-resource examples must demonstrate ephemeral reads
- **Scope**: ephemeral-resource docs under `website/docs/ephemeral-resources/**`.
- **Rule**: The primary example blocks in ephemeral-resource docs MUST use Terraform `ephemeral "azurerm_<name>" "example"` syntax for the documented ephemeral resource.
- **Rule**: Ephemeral-resource examples may include resource and data source blocks needed to source the ephemeral query inputs, but the primary documented object must remain an `ephemeral` block.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - The tracked upstream contributor docs do not currently expose a dedicated contributor topic for ephemeral-resource reference pages
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/ephemeral-resources/key_vault_secret.html.markdown`
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/ephemeral-resources/key_vault_certificate.html.markdown`

### DOCS-EX-025: Function examples must call provider-defined functions
- **Scope**: function docs under `website/docs/functions/**`.
- **Rule**: Function examples MUST call the documented function using `provider::azurerm::<name>(...)` syntax.
- **Rule**: Function docs may include additional example sections such as import-oriented examples when the function is specifically useful there.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - The tracked upstream contributor docs do not currently expose a dedicated contributor topic for provider-defined function reference pages
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/functions/parse_resource_id.html.markdown`
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/functions/normalise_resource_id.html.markdown`

### DOCS-EX-015: Deterministic example name value derivation (nit-level)
- **Scope**: Example Terraform configuration blocks (`## Example*`).
- **Rule**: When the auditor/writer must propose or apply a rename for a name-like argument value, the replacement must be derived deterministically from the Terraform resource/data source type owning the argument.
  - **Resources**: prefer `example-<type-suffix>` where `<type-suffix>` is the Terraform type suffix with underscores replaced by hyphens (for example `azurerm_foo_bar` -> `example-foo-bar`).
  - **Data sources**: prefer `existing-<type-suffix>` using the same derivation.
- **Clarification (mandatory)**: for `name` arguments inside Example HCL blocks, the default value MUST use the **full** owning block's Terraform type suffix (not an abbreviated last segment).
  - Do NOT truncate to the last underscore-delimited segment.
  - Synthetic example: `azurerm_foo_bar_baz` -> `example-foo-bar-baz` (not `example-baz`).
- **Clarification (mandatory)**: this applies to **all** Example blocks on the page, including auxiliary/scaffolding blocks added for self-containedness.
  - Do NOT base an auxiliary block's `name` on the primary resource's type or scenario wording.
  - Synthetic example: if an Example includes both `azurerm_foo_widget` (primary) and `azurerm_bar_dependency` (auxiliary), use `example-foo-widget` and `example-bar-dependency` respectively (not `example-foo-widget-dependency`).
- **Writer behavior**: when you create or update any Example Terraform block (including auxiliary blocks added for self-containedness), you MUST apply this derivation to `name` unless `DOCS-EX-016`/ValidateFunc evidence proves it would be invalid.
- **ValidateFunc-safe fallback**: if schema/implementation evidence shows the preferred value would be invalid, derive a deterministic value that satisfies all proven constraints (allowed characters, separators, casing, and length bounds).
  - Separator selection must be evidence-driven:
    - Prefer `-` when allowed.
    - Otherwise prefer `_` when allowed.
    - Otherwise use no separator when separators are forbidden.
  - Apply proven character/casing constraints:
    - Remove or replace disallowed characters using only transformations justified by evidence.
    - If evidence requires lowercase/uppercase, apply it.
  - Apply proven length constraints:
    - If a maximum length is proven, truncate from the right to fit.
    - If a minimum length is proven and the derived value is shorter, pad deterministically using only characters proven valid by evidence (prefer `1` if digits are allowed; otherwise `a` if letters are allowed).
  - Guardrail: if you cannot determine the allowed character set/separators/length bounds from schema/implementation evidence, or cannot satisfy constraints deterministically (for example a complex regex requirement), do not guess a renamed value (see DOCS-EVID-001).
- **Severity**: this is a nit-level compliance rule and must not, by itself, make a page invalid.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to make example-name fixes deterministic across `/code-review-docs` and `/docs-writer`
  - Helps avoid ad hoc renames that vary from run to run when multiple valid-looking names are possible

### DOCS-EX-016: Example values must respect ValidateFunc constraints
- **Scope**: Example Terraform configuration blocks (`## Example*`).
- **Rule**: If schema/implementation evidence constrains a string value (for example via `ValidateFunc`, regex, length bounds, charset restrictions, or an enum), any example value violating that constraint is invalid and must be fixed.
- **Example**: if evidence forbids hyphens for a field value, any example value containing `-` is invalid.

## Notes

### DOCS-NOTE-001: Note markers must match severity
- `-> **Note:**` informational / guidance
- `~> **Note:**` important operational guidance / pitfalls
- `!> **Note:**` high-impact caution / irreversible or risky actions

### DOCS-NOTE-002: Required conditional notes must be documented
- **Rule**: Cross-field requirements from schema constraints and diff-time validation (e.g., `CustomizeDiff`, expand/flatten rules that enforce compatibility) MUST be documented as notes where they affect valid configuration.
- **Rule**: If a note claims a requirement (e.g. ordering/`depends_on`), the example must match it.

### DOCS-NOTE-005: Conditional requirements must use `~> **Note:**`
- **Rule**: Notes describing conditional requirements/conflicts/compatibility rules that prevent configuration errors MUST use `~> **Note:**` (not `->`).

### DOCS-NOTE-006: ForceNew guidance must use `~> **Note:**`
- **Rule**: Notes warning about ForceNew-related behavior (or guidance intended to prevent ForceNew surprises) should use `~> **Note:**`.

### DOCS-NOTE-003: Note formatting
- **Rule**: Notes must use the exact format: `(->|~>|!>) **Note:** <text>`.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Notes`
  - That guidance says note blocks should follow the exact format `(->|~>|!>) **Note:**`

### DOCS-NOTE-004: Note correctness
- **Rule**: Note content must not contradict schema/implementation behavior.
- **Rule**: If a note states a requirement, the schema/implementation must support it; otherwise rewrite/remove the claim.

### DOCS-NOTE-007: Do not document breaking changes as notes
- **Rule**: Do not add breaking changes as notes in resource documentation.
- **Rule**: Breaking changes in a minor version belong in the changelog; breaking changes in a major version belong in the upgrade guide.

### DOCS-NOTE-008: De-duplicate equivalent notes
- **Rule**: Do not document the same conditional requirement/conflict multiple times in separate notes.
- **Rule**: If two or more notes describe the same constraint (including inverse phrasing), they MUST be merged into a single note that states the full constraint clearly.
- **Example combined note pattern** (adjust wording to match the extracted constraint evidence):
  - `~> **Note:** The `X` block is required when `Y` is set to `A` and must not be specified when `Y` is not set to `A`.`

### DOCS-NOTE-009: Data source, list-resource, ephemeral-resource, and function field notes are prohibited
- **Scope**: data source docs under `website/docs/d/**`, list-resource docs under `website/docs/list-resources/**`, ephemeral-resource docs under `website/docs/ephemeral-resources/**`, and function docs under `website/docs/functions/**`.
- **Rule**: Data source, list-resource, ephemeral-resource, and function documentation for arguments, attributes, and nested fields MUST stay concise and limited to explaining what the field is.
- **Rule**: Those doc types MUST NOT use field-level note blocks for additional caveats, setup guidance, conditional requirements, or extended explanations.
- **Auditor behavior**: any field-level `-> **Note:**`, `~> **Note:**`, or `!> **Note:**` in a data source, list-resource, ephemeral-resource, or function doc is an Issue.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Companion guidance in `.github/instructions/documentation-guidelines.instructions.md` prefers short, field-definitional data source bullets
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` shows concise query-argument bullets for list-resource docs
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/ephemeral-resources/*.html.markdown` show concise ephemeral argument bullets plus only the top-level runtime-support note
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/functions/*.html.markdown` show concise argument lists plus only the top-level runtime-support note
  - Added to keep `/code-review-docs` and `/docs-writer` deterministic and prevent drift toward over-explained non-resource docs

## Arguments Reference

### DOCS-ARG-001: Schema parity (no invented or missing fields)
- **Rule**: Docs must not describe fields that do not exist in the schema.
- **Rule**: Docs must cover schema-exposed arguments/blocks that materially affect configuration validity.

### DOCS-ARG-002: Required vs optional ordering
- **Rule**: Arguments must follow the upstream provider ordering:
  1) any arguments that make up the resource/data source ID, with the last user-specified segment (usually `name`) first
  2) `location` (if present)
  3) remaining required arguments (alphabetical)
  4) optional arguments (alphabetical), with `tags` always last
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Arguments` -> `Ordering`
  - That guidance defines ID-segment ordering, `location`, required arguments, then optional arguments with `tags` last

### DOCS-ARG-012: List-resource query arguments should be ordered alphabetically
- **Scope**: list-resource docs under `website/docs/list-resources/**`.
- **Rule**: Query arguments in list-resource docs should be ordered alphabetically.
- **Rule**: If the list-resource config schema marks an argument as required, keep required arguments first and then order within required and optional groups alphabetically.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/guide-list-resource.md` shows `resource_group_name` before `subscription_id` in the list-resource `Argument Reference`
  - List-resource query config documents filters rather than resource identity fields, so the resource/data-source ID ordering pattern does not apply directly

### DOCS-ARG-013: Function argument lists must follow function signature order
- **Scope**: function docs under `website/docs/functions/**`.
- **Rule**: The `## Arguments` section for function docs MUST list parameters in the same order as the implementation signature.
- **Rule**: Function arguments should be documented as ordered list items rather than resource-style argument bullets.
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - The tracked upstream contributor docs do not currently expose a dedicated contributor topic for provider-defined function reference pages
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/provider/function/parse_resource_id.go`
  - Upstream provider implementation in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/internal/provider/function/normalise_resource_id.go`
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/functions/parse_resource_id.html.markdown`
  - Upstream provider docs under `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/website/docs/functions/normalise_resource_id.html.markdown`

### DOCS-ARG-003: ForceNew behavior must be documented
- **Rule**: For `ForceNew: true` arguments, include the standard ForceNew sentence (see DOCS-WORD-001).

### DOCS-ARG-010: ID-segment ordering must be evidence-based
- **Rule**: Arguments that form the resource/data source ID (ID segments) must be identified using schema/implementation evidence (not assumptions).
- **Auditor behavior**: when enforcing ID-segment ordering, cite evidence from `internal/**` (for example the resource ID parser/type used by Importer/Create/Read).
- **Guardrail**: if you cannot confidently determine which arguments are ID segments from evidence, do not guess an ordering-based Issue; record an Observation describing what evidence is missing (see DOCS-EVID-001).

### DOCS-ARG-008: Argument descriptions must be concise
- **Rule**: Argument descriptions should be concise and avoid excessive detail or external links.
- **Rule**: In resource docs, if more detail is needed, use a note block under the argument.
- **Rule**: In data source docs, keep the bullet short and limited to explaining what the field is; do not add field-level note blocks or extended caveats.
- **Rule**: Core argument semantics should remain in the bullet when they read cleanly, including the field definition, `Possible values are ...`, and `Defaults to ...` when applicable.
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Companion guidance in `.github/instructions/documentation-guidelines.instructions.md`
  - Contract rule `DOCS-NOTE-009` for data source field-level note prohibition

### DOCS-ARG-011: Argument bullet length cap
- **Rule**: Each argument bullet description MUST be a crisp definition of the field (prefer 1 sentence; 2 sentences maximum).
- **Rule**: Do not move core argument semantics into a note purely for brevity when they fit cleanly in the bullet. In particular, keep `Possible values are ...` and `Defaults to ...` in the bullet unless doing so would make the bullet unwieldy.
- **Rule**: In resource docs, additional caveats, conditional requirements, setup instructions, or multi-paragraph explanations MUST be moved into an inline note under the argument (see DOCS-ARG-008 and DOCS-NOTE-003).
- **Rule**: In data source docs, field-level note blocks are prohibited (see DOCS-NOTE-009); keep the bullet concise, short, and focused on what the field is.
- **Placement**: In resource docs, the note block MUST appear immediately under the argument bullet it applies to (do not move this content into a separate “Notes” section, and do not leave it embedded in the bullet).
- **Marker**: In resource docs, use `-> **Note:**` for informational setup/background. Use `~> **Note:**` when the note describes a conditional requirement/conflict that affects valid configuration.

Example (rewrite long bullet to bullet + note):
- Before (non-compliant):
  - ``* `foo_id` - (Optional) The ID of the related resource. If you are using a managed DNS service ...``
- After (compliant):
  - ``* `foo_id` - (Optional) The ID of the related resource.``
  - `-> **Note:** If you are using a managed DNS service, you may need to delegate your DNS zone; otherwise validate by creating the required DNS records manually.`
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to keep argument bullets short and deterministic across `/code-review-docs` and `/docs-writer`
  - Companion guidance in `.github/instructions/documentation-guidelines.instructions.md` keeps core semantics in the bullet and moves only excess caveats into notes

### DOCS-ARG-009: ForceNew sentence placement
- **Scope**: resources only.
- **Rule**: When present, the ForceNew sentence must appear at the end of the argument description.

### DOCS-ARG-006: ForceNew sentence scope (resources vs data sources)
- **Rule**: Resource docs must use the ForceNew sentence for `ForceNew: true` fields.
- **Rule**: Data source docs must not use ForceNew wording (data sources do not create resources).
- **Rule**: List-resource docs must not use ForceNew wording (list resources do not create resources).
- **Rule**: Ephemeral-resource docs must not use ForceNew wording (ephemeral resources do not create managed resources).
- **Rule**: Function docs must not use ForceNew wording (functions do not create managed resources).

### DOCS-ARG-007: Required arguments must be documented
- **Rule**: All schema required arguments/blocks must be documented in Arguments Reference.

### DOCS-ARG-004: Defaults must be documented
- **Rule**: When schema defines a default value, docs must include a `Defaults to ...` sentence.

### DOCS-ARG-005: Validations must be documented (when constraining user input)
- **Rule**: When schema validations constrain values (enums, bounds, etc.), docs must describe allowed values using the standard wording (see DOCS-WORD-002).

---

## Attributes Reference

### DOCS-ATTR-001: Attributes ordering
- **Rule**: `id` first, then remaining computed attributes alphabetical.

### DOCS-ATTR-002: Computed attribute coverage
- **Rule**: Computed attributes surfaced by the schema should be documented.

### DOCS-ATTR-003: Attribute descriptions must not include defaults/enums
- **Rule**: Attribute descriptions should be concise and must not include possible values or default values (those belong in Arguments Reference).
- **Rule**: Attribute descriptions must not use lifecycle, mutation, or import wording (for example `Creates`, `Updates`, `Deletes`, `Import`, or ForceNew wording); they should describe exported data only.

### DOCS-ATTR-004: Do not special-case common fields in Attributes Reference
- **Rule**: Do not special-case `name`, `resource_group_name`, `location`, or `tags` under `## Attributes Reference`.
- **Rule**: Ordering is always `id` first, then remaining attributes alphabetical.

### DOCS-ATTR-005: Nested block attribute ordering (Attributes Reference)
- **Scope**: nested attribute bullets inside a block subsection under `## Attributes Reference` (i.e. under `A `<block>` block exports the following:`).
- **Rule**: If a nested `id` attribute is present, it MUST be listed first.
- **Rule**: Remaining nested attributes MUST be listed alphabetically.
- **Rule**: Any note blocks that apply to a nested attribute MUST remain directly attached to that attribute when reordering.

---

## Wording

### DOCS-WORD-003: Resource vs data source summary sentence
- **Rule**: Resource docs should start with an action verb (prefer `Manages ...`).
- **Rule**: Data source docs should start with a retrieval verb (prefer `Gets information about ...`).
- **Rule**: List-resource docs should start with a list verb (prefer `Lists ... resources.`).
- **Rule**: Ephemeral-resource docs should start with `Use this to access information about an existing ...`.
- **Rule**: Function docs should start with an implementation-backed behavior sentence (prefer `Takes ...` for input-transforming functions).
- **Rule**: Data source summary sentences must not use resource-only wording (for example `Manages`, `Creates`, or ForceNew wording).
- **Rule**: List-resource summary sentences must not use resource-only or data-source-only wording (for example `Manages`, `Creates`, or `Gets information about ...`).
- **Rule**: Ephemeral-resource summary sentences must not use managed-resource wording such as `Manages` or `Creates`.
- **Rule**: Function summary sentences must not use resource/data source wording such as `Manages`, `Creates`, or `Gets information about an existing ...`.

### DOCS-WORD-004: `*_enabled` field phrasing
- **Rule**: In resource docs, for boolean fields ending in `_enabled`, prefer: `Whether <thing> is enabled.`
- **Rule**: When a default is known in resource docs, add a separate sentence: `Defaults to `<value>`.`
- **Rule**: In data source docs, prefer: `Whether <thing> is enabled.`
- **Rule**: Derive `<thing>` from the field name by removing the trailing `_enabled`, replacing underscores with spaces, and wrapping the result in backticks.

### DOCS-WORD-001: ForceNew sentence
- **Rule**: The ForceNew sentence MUST be exactly: `Changing this forces a new resource to be created.`
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Arguments` -> `Descriptions`
  - That guidance says ForceNew argument descriptions must end with `Changing this forces a new resource to be created.`

### DOCS-WORD-002: Enum wording
- **Rule**: Use `Possible values are ...`.
- **Single-value case**: use `The only possible value is ...`.
- **Range case**: use `Possible values range between `x` and `y`.` when the validation defines a numeric range.
- **Rule (mandatory rewrite):** replace legacy enum phrasing with the canonical phrasing.
  - Replace `Valid options are` with `Possible values are`.
  - Replace `Valid values are` with `Possible values are`.
  - Replace `Possible values include` with `Possible values are`.
- **Provenance**: Published upstream standard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Upstream contributor guidance in `hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm/contributing/topics/reference-documentation-standards.md` under `Arguments` -> `Descriptions`
  - That guidance defines the canonical wording for enums, single-value constraints, and numeric ranges

### DOCS-WORD-005: Oxford comma for lists
- **Rule**: For lists of 3+ items in prose (including enum lists), use the Oxford comma.
- **Example**: `Possible values are `A`, `B`, and `C`.` (not `Possible values are `A`, `B` and `C`.`)

### DOCS-WORD-006: Use the canonical resource name in section prose
- **Scope**: resource docs under `website/docs/r/**`.
- **Rule**: In `## Attributes Reference`, `## Timeouts`, and `## Import`, prose that refers to the documented resource object MUST use the page's canonical resource name from the summary sentence, not a broader generic service object name.
- **Rule**: The canonical resource name is the singular resource noun phrase used in the summary sentence (for example, from `Manages an Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set ...`, use `Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set`).
- **Rule**: This applies to descriptive phrases such as attribute descriptions, timeout action lines, and import lead-in sentences.
- **Examples**:
  - Prefer `The ID of the Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set.` over `The ID of the Virtual Machine Scale Set.`
  - Prefer `Used when creating the Orchestrated Virtual Machine Scale Set.` over `Used when creating the Virtual Machine Scale Set.`
- **Provenance**: Local safeguard.
- **Evidence**:
  - Added to prevent generic service-object wording drift in `Attributes Reference`, `Timeouts`, and `Import`
  - Enforced through this repository's docs contract rather than a clearly codified upstream wording rule

### DOCS-WORD-007: Use Azure proper-name capitalization in field prose
- **Rule**: When documentation prose refers to the Azure object `Resource Group`, capitalize it as `Resource Group` rather than `resource group`.
- **Rule**: This applies to common field descriptions such as `resource_group_name` bullets in both resource and data source docs.
- **Scope**: Use this capitalization when referring to the Azure object name, not when writing generic prose about grouping resources conceptually.
- **Examples**:
  - Prefer `The name of the Resource Group.` over `The name of the resource group.`
  - Prefer `The name of the Resource Group where the Resource exists.` over `The name of the resource group where the Resource exists.`
- **Provenance**: Inferred maintainer convention.
- **Evidence**:
  - Reviewer suggestion in hashicorp/terraform-provider-azurerm PR `#31957`, discussion `r3116933429`
  - Existing companion guidance examples in `.github/instructions/documentation-guidelines.instructions.md`

---

## Timeouts

### DOCS-TIMEOUT-001: Duration readability
- **Rule**: Defaults greater than 60 minutes must be expressed in hours (and match the schema default where available).
- **Rule**: Keep minutes for values `<= 60 minutes`.
- **Example rewrites**:
  - `(Defaults to 720 minutes)` → `(Defaults to 12 hours)`
  - `(Defaults to 1440 minutes)` → `(Defaults to 24 hours)`

### DOCS-TIMEOUT-002: Timeouts link format
- **Rule**: For new resources, use `https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/configure#define-operation-timeouts`.
- **Rule**: For existing resources, keep the legacy `https://www.terraform.io/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts` link to maintain consistency unless updating the section.

### DOCS-TIMEOUT-003: New vs existing timeouts link enforcement
- **Rule**: If a documentation page is newly added, any Timeouts section must use the new developer.hashicorp.com link (see DOCS-TIMEOUT-002).
- **Auditor behavior**:
  - If you can determine the docs page is newly added from the available git context, treat a legacy link as an Issue.
  - If the page is existing/modified, treat a legacy link as allowed (no Issue).
  - If you cannot determine new vs existing from available context, record an Observation (not an Issue).

## Language

### DOCS-LANG-001: Fix obvious typos and grammar
- **Rule**: Obvious typos and grammar mistakes in documentation must be fixed.
- **Auditor behavior**: only raise an Issue when the fix is unambiguous and can be provided as an exact patch-ready replacement.

---

## Links

### DOCS-LINK-001: Locale-neutral Microsoft Learn links
- **Rule**: Avoid locale segments like `/en-us/` in documentation URLs unless required.

---

## Deprecations (vNext)

### DOCS-DEPR-001: Next-major deprecations
- **Rule**: When schema indicates next-major deprecations (feature flag patterns), docs should focus on vNext surface area.
- **Rule**: Do not require documenting legacy fields that are not part of the vNext surface area (for example fields gated behind a next-major feature flag, or fields marked as deprecated/removed in the next major version).

### DOCS-DEPR-002: Legacy (non-vNext) fields must not be documented
- **Rule**: When schema/implementation evidence indicates a field is legacy-only (not part of the vNext surface area), docs MUST NOT document that field.
- **Auditor behavior**: if a legacy-only field appears in `## Arguments Reference` or `## Attributes Reference`, record an Issue.
