# AzureRM Acceptance Testing (TestAcc)

## Canonical sources of truth (contract-driven)

When writing or troubleshooting acceptance tests under `internal/**/*_test.go`, use `.github/instructions/testing-compliance-contract.instructions.md` as the single source of truth for:

- canonical sources and precedence
- testing compliance requirements
- `TEST-*` rule families

Do not treat this skill as a second independent compliance source.

## Mandatory: read the entire skill

Before applying this skill, read this file to EOF.

## Preflight checklist

Before editing tests with this skill, complete this checklist:

- [ ] I have read this skill to EOF.
- [ ] I have loaded `.github/instructions/testing-compliance-contract.instructions.md` to EOF and applied the relevant `TEST-*` rules.
- [ ] I have identified the closest same-service `_test.go` pattern under `internal/**`.
- [ ] I have identified whether the task needs companion testing guidance from `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md`.

If preflight is incomplete, do not proceed with acceptance-test work.

## Companion guidance

Use this file for worked examples and specialized testing guidance after loading the contract:

- `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md`

## Verification (assistant response only)

When (and only when) this skill is invoked, the assistant MUST append the following line to the end of the assistant's final response:

Skill used: acceptance-testing

Rules:
- Do NOT write this marker into any repository file (docs, code, generated files).
- If multiple skills are invoked, each skill should append its own `Skill used: ...` line.
- Do NOT emit the marker in intermediate/progress updates; only in the final response.

## Template tokens (placeholders)

When you need a placeholder in examples or guidance, always use the explicit token format `{{TOKEN_NAME}}`.

Rules:
- Use ALL-CAPS token names with underscores (for example `{{RESOURCE_NAME}}`, `{{TEST_NAME}}`).
- Do not use ambiguous placeholders like `<name>` or `...`.
- Do not leave tokens in final repository output; tokens are for skill guidance/examples only.
- If any `{{...}}` token would appear in final output, replace it before responding.

## Safety first

Intended for use with the HashiCorp `terraform-provider-azurerm` repository (acceptance test framework under `internal/`).

Acceptance tests create real Azure resources and can incur cost.

Before running tests:

- Confirm credentials are configured.
- Prefer narrow test runs (single test) over running the full suite.
- Ensure cleanup/destroy behavior is covered.

## Execution workflow

Use the upstream acceptance-test entry point as the default command shape:

- `make acctests SERVICE='{{SERVICE_NAME}}' TESTARGS='-run={{TEST_NAME}}' TESTTIMEOUT='60m'`

Expected shell environment for acceptance-test runs includes:

- `ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`
- `ARM_CLIENT_ID`
- `ARM_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `ARM_TENANT_ID`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION`
- `ARM_TEST_LOCATION_ALT`

Execution rules:

- Prefer the smallest `-run` scope that proves the change.
- Prefer rerunning one failing test over broad service-wide or suite-wide retries.
- Treat unit-test runs and acceptance-test runs as different workflows; do not present `go test ./...` as a substitute for a targeted acceptance run.

Example narrow run:

```text
make acctests SERVICE='{{SERVICE_NAME}}' TESTARGS='-run=TestAcc{{RESOURCE_NAME}}_basic' TESTTIMEOUT='60m'
```

## Core patterns to follow

- Acceptance test framework conventions:
   - `data := acceptance.BuildTestData(t, "azurerm_x", "test")`
   - `r := SomeResource{}`

- Default resource test matrix should cover the core lifecycle:
   - At a minimum, plan for `basic`, `requiresImport`, `complete`, `update`, and import validation when import is supported.
   - Only omit one of those when the resource behavior or provider pattern makes it genuinely not applicable.

- Use resource-specific `preCheck` helpers when tests need extra prerequisites:
   - If a test depends on optional shared infrastructure or environment variables beyond the global Azure auth and location checks, add a receiver method named `preCheck(t *testing.T)` on the test helper struct and call it near the start of each affected `TestAcc...`.
   - Prefer `t.Skip(...)` or `t.Skipf(...)` when those optional prerequisites are absent.
   - Keep the helper near the tests that call it, commonly before the `Exists` or `Destroy` helpers.

- New-resource list coverage:
   - When a new resource includes a list resource, also plan a dedicated `*_resource_list_test.go` file.
   - Use Terraform 1.14 query tests for the list resource and provision multiple resources so the list query path is meaningfully exercised.
   - Only omit list-resource acceptance coverage when the resource is using a maintainer-reviewed upstream exception path such as `allow-without-list` or `list-not-supported`.

- Ephemeral-resource coverage:
   - Use the service-local `*_ephemeral_test.go` pattern with `acceptance.BuildTestData(t, "ephemeral.azurerm_<name>", ...)`.
   - Gate the test on Terraform 1.10 support and use the framework provider factories required by the upstream ephemeral-resource test pattern.
   - When validating ephemeral output payloads, prefer the `echo` provider plus config-state checks rather than inventing a one-off assertion pattern.

- Provider-defined function coverage:
   - Use focused unit tests under `internal/provider/function/*_test.go`.
   - Gate the tests on Terraform 1.8 support, use framework provider factories, and assert outputs from `provider::azurerm::<name>(...)` calls.

- Basic tests should validate existence:
   - Primary check should be `check.That(data.ResourceName).ExistsInAzure(r)`.

- Prefer ImportStep:
   - `data.ImportStep()` typically provides broad field validation.
   - Add extra checks only for computed/edge behavior that import cannot verify.

- RequiresImport tests:
   - For resources, plan for `requiresImport` coverage by default using `data.RequiresImportErrorStep`.
   - Only omit it when the resource pattern gives a concrete reason that it is not applicable.

- Provider feature-flagged CRUD branch coverage:
   - When a provider features block setting changes create, update, delete, import, overwrite, or destroy semantics, consider whether the non-default branch needs one focused acceptance test.
   - If the branch requires a pre-existing remote object, prefer the existing harness pattern of applying prerequisite infrastructure first, then using `CheckWithClientForResource`, `CheckWithClientWithoutResource`, or `CheckWithClient`, as appropriate, to create or modify the remote object outside Terraform, then applying the feature-enabled Terraform configuration.
   - When one of those callback helpers needs to call an Azure polling helper such as `CreateOrUpdateThenPoll`, `CreateOrReplaceThenPoll`, `UpdateThenPoll`, or `DeleteThenPoll`, do not pass the callback `ctx` directly into the poller.
   - First wrap the callback `ctx` with `context.WithTimeout(...)` or `context.WithDeadline(...)`, because callback helpers may supply a context that does not already carry a deadline and Azure pollers require one.
   - Use a timeout appropriate for the setup or mutation operation, commonly 15 to 60 minutes for Azure LRO-style acceptance-test setup.
   - Prefer this direct Azure setup pattern over creating two Terraform-managed resources that intentionally target the same remote ID.
   - Keep the scenario narrow: prove the feature-enabled branch with one high-signal test unless sibling resources have materially different behavior.
   - For the detailed bad-vs-good callback-poller example and repo-local evidence, use `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md` rather than expanding this skill into a second example-heavy authority source.

- Quota-sensitive acceptance execution is a separate concern:
   - For services with hard subscription quotas or low service limits, prefer sequential acceptance execution patterns such as `ResourceSequentialTest(...)`, `DataSourceTestInSequence(...)`, or runner-level `-parallel=1`.
   - Do not conflate quota-sensitive failures with missing-context-deadline failures in callback-based poller setup.

- Do not add acctests for simple property validation by default:
   - If a property validator is already covered adequately by a unit test, do not add an acceptance test only to re-prove that validation.
   - Add an acceptance validation test only when it proves behavior that unit coverage does not, such as broader lifecycle behavior or Azure-specific runtime constraints.

- Add acctests for CustomizeDiff logic:
   - Add targeted acceptance-test coverage for CustomizeDiff validation paths so invalid field combinations and Azure-specific cross-field constraints are not left untested.
   - Prefer `ExpectError` scenarios for the invalid paths, while letting the broader `basic`, `update`, `complete`, and import flows cover the corresponding success paths unless extra assertions are needed.

- Keep fmt.Sprintf-based config helpers concise:
   - When a helper returns `fmt.Sprintf(...)`, pass one-use nested helper calls like `r.template(data)` or `r.basic(data)` directly into the format call instead of assigning a temporary local that is only forwarded once.
   - Keep a local only when the value is reused, transformed, or materially improves readability.

- Keep embedded Terraform formatting valid:
   - When editing Terraform heredocs in `*_test.go` files, use two spaces for configuration indentation and never tabs.
   - When editing Terraform heredocs in `*_test.go` files, consult the `Embedded Terraform Formatting` examples in `.github/instructions/testing-guidelines.instructions.md` and match the recommended pattern.

- Prefer associated resource `complete(data)` setup by default in data source tests:
   - When a data source test composes its setup from an associated resource helper and a `complete(data)` helper exists, prefer that helper as the default setup shape.
   - Reuse `basic(data)` or another scenario-specific helper instead when no `complete(data)` helper exists, when the test is intentionally narrow, or when `complete(data)` adds unrelated setup or coupling.
   - Keep a broader helper when the data source scenario genuinely depends on the fuller associated resource shape.

- Keep helper struct names canonical across all acceptance test variants:
   - In acceptance test files under `internal/services/**`, use one canonical helper struct name per Terraform resource or data source.
   - If a surface already has an established canonical helper type, preserve and reuse that same type across all related acceptance tests and generated identity tests.
   - For new surfaces without an established canonical helper type, prefer `ToCamel(x)Resource` for resources and `ToCamel(x)DataSource` for data sources.
   - When a new resource includes generated identity tests, verify the generated helper-name casing early with a narrow `go generate` run and keep the canonical helper type aligned across the main resource tests, list tests, data source setup references, and generated identity tests.
   - Keep that same helper type across all acceptance test variants for the same Terraform surface, including the main resource tests, list tests, identity-related tests, and any other helper-instantiating acceptance tests.
   - Generated identity tests under `*_identity_gen_test.go` should instantiate that same helper type directly.
   - Do not introduce separate `SomethingIdentityResource` helpers, alternate helper names, alias types, or wrapper structs just to satisfy a specific test variant.
   - Keep the naming stable across all acceptance tests and generated identity tests so `go generate` produces no diff and Generation Check stays green.

## Troubleshooting workflow

When a test fails:

- Read the error carefully and identify if it is:
   - auth/environment related
   - eventual consistency / polling
   - schema mismatch
   - cleanup/destroy

- Re-run only the failing test:
   - Use the smallest `-run` scope possible.

- If the failure is a state mismatch:
   - Check expand/flatten symmetry.
   - Confirm ForceNew vs Update behavior.
   - Confirm PATCH behavior (omitted vs explicitly disabled fields).

Common cleanup blockers to consider during troubleshooting:

- `ResourceGroupBeingDeleted`
- soft-delete or purge-protection conflicts
- protection or health-monitoring features that block normal destroy timing

When provider feature flags are the accepted cleanup path for the resource family, use the existing provider-pattern cleanup flags instead of inventing one-off destroy workarounds.

## Output expectation

When asked to write tests, produce:

- A `basic` TestAcc
- A `requiresImport` TestAcc
- An `update` TestAcc
- A `complete` TestAcc
- Import validation via `ImportStep()`
- Only omit `requiresImport` coverage when the resource pattern gives a concrete reason that it is not applicable
