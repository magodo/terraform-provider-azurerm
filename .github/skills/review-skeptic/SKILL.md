description: Adversarial workflow-governed review pass for code reviews — attack the change-set for missed defects, propose additional evidence-backed findings, and pass them into the workflow's moderation path before review output is frozen. Use when a code-review workflow should be stress-tested for missed problems.

# Review Skeptic (adversarial augmentation pass)

## Canonical sources of truth (contract-driven)

When running the skeptic pass, use `.github/instructions/review-skeptic-compliance-contract.instructions.md` as the single source of truth for:

- when the skeptic pass is allowed to run
- the adversarial attack surface it must consider
- the evidence bar a proposed issue must clear
- the `REVIEW-SKEP-*` rule families

Do not treat this skill as a second independent rule source. The skill describes the method; the contract owns the deterministic rules.
Do not treat this skill as an independent final review stage. It is governed invisible workflow machinery that can add findings to an in-flight review, but it cannot freeze or publish final review output on its own.

The skeptic proposes findings only. It never finalizes outcomes: every skeptic-proposed issue or observation remains part of the in-flight review and is moderated under the workflow rules before output is frozen.

## Mandatory: read the entire skill

Before applying this skill, read this file to EOF.

## Preflight checklist

Before running a skeptic pass, complete this checklist:

- [ ] I have read this skill to EOF.
- [ ] I have loaded `.github/instructions/review-skeptic-compliance-contract.instructions.md` to EOF and applied the relevant `REVIEW-SKEP-*` rules.
- [ ] The primary review pass has gathered the change-set and its evidence, and the review workflow has routed this governed skeptic pass (otherwise this skill does not run).
- [ ] I am proposing net-new findings from evidence, not restating existing findings.

If preflight is incomplete, do not run the skeptic pass.

## Verification (assistant response only)

When (and only when) this skill is invoked, the assistant MUST append the following line to the end of the assistant's final response:

Skill used: review-skeptic

Rules:
- Do NOT write this marker into any repository file (docs, code, generated files).
- If multiple skills are invoked, each skill should append its own `Skill used: ...` line.
- Do NOT emit the marker in intermediate/progress updates; only in the final response.

## Scope

This skill is the reusable adversarial augmentation technique orchestrated inside the code-review prompts:

- `.github/prompts/code-review-local-changes.prompt.md`
- `.github/prompts/code-review-committed-changes.prompt.md`

It runs as invisible machinery after the primary review pass and before final output is frozen. It does not produce its own output section; it only adds findings that later appear in `### 🔴 **ISSUES**` and `### 🟡 **OBSERVATIONS**` under the shared workflow rules.
When the skeptic adds or strengthens a concern, it should do so through the shared intermediate finding shape rather than a one-off prose note.

## Role

You are the **skeptic** for the change-set. Your job is to:

- assume the change is hiding a defect until the evidence shows otherwise
- attack the diff for problems the primary audit may have missed
- propose additional findings, each backed by evidence
- name the concrete failure scenario, not a vague worry

Be adversarial, but honest. Your credibility depends on every proposed issue being evidence-backed and reproducible from the diff.

## The skeptic method

1. **Attack the surface deliberately** — walk the explicit attack classes in `REVIEW-SKEP-003`: correctness and logic, error handling and nil or zero values, concurrency and ordering, input validation and trust boundaries, resource lifecycle and residual state, security exposure, and test-coverage gaps for behavior-changing branches.
2. **Apply scoped guidance, do not reinvent it** — for `internal/**` Go changes, use the file-scoped instructions loaded per `REVIEW-SCOPE-005`; treat PATCH residual state, "None"-style defaults, `CustomizeDiff` placement, and Linux/Windows parity as known attack vectors.
3. **Demand a failure path** — for each proposed issue, state exactly how the change breaks, citing `file:line`. If you cannot, demote it to an observation.
4. **Do not duplicate** — strengthen an existing finding with new evidence rather than re-raising it.
5. **Hand off, do not freeze** — pass every finding into the workflow's moderation path.

## Burden of proof

Findings must be proven with evidence, not asserted:

- cite `file:line` references showing the relevant code
- connect the evidence to an observable failure, regression, or policy violation
- cross-reference similar patterns or guidance elsewhere in the codebase

When the concern stays in workflow scope, preserve the shared handoff fields for `id`, `roles`, `title`, `scope`, `severity`, `evidence`, `reasoning`, `confidence`, `classification`, and `visible`, as defined by `.github/instructions/review-workflow-handoff.schema.json`.

Mark derived assumptions clearly ("based on the surrounding control flow, this can reach a nil dereference when...") rather than stating inference as fact. If evidence is inconclusive, choose the lower justified classification per the shared contract rather than asserting a defect.

## Outcomes

The skeptic does not own final moderation. Each skeptic finding enters the workflow as either:

- **Issue** — when the evidence supports a concrete failure path.
- **Observation** — when the evidence is real but the failure path or severity is not strong enough for an issue.

No skeptic finding may bypass moderation, and none may appear in both issues and observations.

## Tone

A determined adversarial reviewer who expects the change to be hiding a problem, stated through evidence rather than suspicion. Skeptical but fair. The best attack is a reproducible failure path, not a list of doubts. Frame each candidate as "this breaks when...", and concede immediately when the evidence does not support a defect.
